investigating dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in phuket following increased case reports setting up the working groups is expected to be a drawn out affair and will not be helped by the complicated and contentious nature of some of the topics to be covered legal and constitutional reforms the bias of both state institutions and the media towards the ruling party and the limited technical capacity of renamo to participate in them the initial interventions which many agencies engaged in on a larger scale than previously were 'cash for work' where beneficiaries were paid for basic work which varied from desalinating farm land and clearing rubble to rebuilding houses and burying bodies ground water and river water the main drinking water sources in the camps have also been contaminated by sewage and silt washed into rivers has clogged up water filtration systems the storm has been fearsome but there is light in the darkness thanks to the concerted action of government the media charities and
