We really do not know the answer to your question As a doctor my common sense tells me that untreated hypertension should represent a risk factor though Studies are needed in order to say for sure|1
Thats what Im wondering and confused about|0
 Think about it  His doctors come  to him and say Mr President you have been exposed to the virus and  we need to get you tested Which response is more likely1   Trump does the responsible adult thing and follows the doctors  advice  Knowing full well that if the test comes back positive A he  would have to selfisolate which means no more contact with his fawning  cult followers and he couldnt have any more rallies B the media  might find out and reveal to the American public that Mr Perfect  ImTheHealthiestManWhoEverBecamePresident actually has the virus  that he keeps insisting is no big deal and C hed have to confront  the scary news he might die soonor2   Trump refuses to get the test saying I dont have any virus my  immune system is perfect  I dont need any test And he continues to  put the people around him at risk because its more important to him to  keep up the pretense that hes perfect and invulnerable  not to  mention his insatiable need for social contact with sycophants and  adoring crowds who feed his egoTrump is the freaking President If he doesnt want to test whos going to force him|1
Corona is still being censored on many subbreddits I was banned from rmarvelstudios for a joke post that Thanos warned us of overpopulation and he was trying to prevent Corona virus And we called him a mad man Post was deletedcensored in secondsI instantly got dozens of downvotes and a ban Yes It was sort of a joke post but it all happened in seconds Bots downvoting every mention of Corona Every time I say the world Corona on rBaltimore its dozens of downvotes In just seconds|0

Luckily in Michigan everyone can get an Absentee Ballot now so i wouldnt have to worry about that|1
Which is also important in preventing deaths You cannot remove the fact that deaths also rise when the economy does worse This virus isnt the only political issue of the day|0
His is a super selfish attitude and really callous its as if he doesnt care that old and sick people are PEOPLE And have people that love them To reframe it with a bit of empathy however Ive been trying to soften towards people like this as their underlying emotion is probably deep fear like the rest of us but they are processing it differently by trying to force a logical view or push it away from themselves This doesnt excuse saying horrible stuff like this but helps me at least calm my extreme feelings towards people like this I have bad coping methods too in some ways but they can make me feel personally safe and so I have to hope thats whats happening here and no one is actually this hateful|1
No one said oh look people suddenly succumbing to the flu Dont think anyone thinks the flu hits you suddenly like you were shot These are people that are probably infected and pass out from exhaustion while trying to walk around town I had the flu years ago and could barely walk to the bathroom so this is believable|0

The coverage for Oxford has been horrificThe first case for Oxford was announced 20 mins later the first death was announced then the 100 case mark was announced following very loose detailsLeaves anyone in Oxford without home front details local news doesnt have a clue either|0
They do have the 1918 virus from some Inuit womens corpse and corpses of soldiers apparently but I believe the assumption of cytokine storms is based on symptoms and the fact that people who died were those with the strongest immune systems while the old and very young died less with their weaker immune systems Interesting note that SARS 2001 also killed some people with cytokine storm so Corona viruses are definitely able to do so|0
Good news fewer stupid people in 12 months  But what a price we will pay|0
thank you|1
The grocery store near me just unionized It must have been in the works for a while but the workers have a lot of leverage right now to get not only better pay but better health insurance and sick leave benefits which makes everyone in the community safer I hope it becomes a trend But even if it doesnt Id rather shop there than at nonunion businesses where I dont know if someone is being economically forced to work when its unsafe so its a good deal for management too|1
There is a difference in being incapable of testing and choosing not to test or write them off even though they tested positive when asymptomatic I think thats what the issue is here the numbers would be at least a little more accurate if everyone tested mattered but their government is trying to save face at their expense and ours|1

Yes  but with the caveat that too high of temp becomes harmful to the human cells too  I think a general rule is anything over 103 you want to start taking fever reducers  But a low grade fever of 99102 helps your body fight infections by making conditions uncomfortable for the invading organism that finds the normal human temperature hospitable|0
Nobody knows Im also in the EU and the same thing is happening where I live Lots of people lost their jobs already and this is only the beginning|0
But that study looked at in vitro cells treated the cells and the virus with the extract then infected the cells in the presence of the extract and incubated them for 24 hours in the extract so Id say its not clear that those results transfer in any way to taking Elderberry extract and expecting it to somehow have the same effect systemically|0
Theres no specific treatment for corona virusso besides keeping track of the virus confirming it doesnt change management Its just supportive care  Regular flu there are medications but they only work well if taken within like the first 24 hoursRemember death rate is 23 so low  But higher than the flu which is 1 this is what some places report but it seems higher than this to me The vast majority of deaths are in mainland China so who knows whats going on there  Just like regular flu the vast majority of the mortalities are in the elderly over 65 httpwwwcidrapumnedunewsperspective202002study72000covid19patientsfinds23deathrateI say this because even if you contract it statistically speaking you are very likely to ultimately Be fine   Other than you know having the flu Stay away from grandmaGood luck|0

This was my thought after the Michigan governor endorsed Biden then we had covid tests pending right up until after the polls were closed Trump canceled his trip here U of M tested computers for being able to do online schooling I also heard through the grapevine from someone who visits Channel 4 news weekly that the decision not to notify people was passed down from the feds in order not to cause panic on voting day This isnt verifiable but I trust the person who told me Then only after all that did the two positive cases get announcedWhitmer couldnt let the old folks stay at home and let the young voters have Sanders take the stateEdit To put my conspiracy theoristlike mindset at ease I have FOIAd the MDHHS for documents relating to this|1
I have a medical degree I spend most of my days in a lab in the UK studying viruses and I agree with these points Alcohol is a substance that evaporates so quickly that it has no impact on microorganisms and not on viruses During our tests we tested various viruses on different surfaces Viruses in general contain a sticky layer on the outside that will flush off with a good detergent Each person has bacteria on the skin It is impossible to desinfect a 100 but these bacteria species are in balance They even fight for space on the human skin and that balance is very important It has been like that for millions of years Agressive substances like alcohol will disturb that balance and remove the oily substances from the skin The perfect condition for skin infections Soap and water will do the work Wash the hands with a little nailbrush We do that on a daily base and it is sufficient|1

Churchill wasnt minister of healthI would say its also a matter of optics A minister of health I think should at the very least look healthyI would have a problem if she was at least semicompetentWeve had almost 3 months to prepare3 MONTHS And after all that time when the virus hits here because the adequate measures had not been put in place her advice was wash your hands Fucking be proactive Take some measuresI would have asked China how they built those temporary hospitalsquarantine unitsI would have had those built ASAPI would have stopped all flights tofrom China and any other country with casesI would have put anyone suspected in quarantine FORCED quarantine not that weak ass sauce voluntary one which allows morons to ignore it and go spread the disease in clubs pubs markets at their job in schools on public transport etcAggressively track anyone theyd been in contact with and place them in supervised quarantine in their homes together with their families which by that time would have presumably been infected too Test them all twice daily make it clear that if they break quarantine they will have to pay ENORMOUS fines I would have stocked up on masks and ingredients for testing kitsI would have told companies to prepare for hard quarantines Put things in place to allow for remote workingPrepared a plan to make sure people can still buy groceries pay their billsPrepared plans to have food delivered to people so they stay indoorsPrepared the financial details to see how much the government can help all those affected Give money to people who must miss work give affected businesses temporary tax cuts after the crisis blows over Give money to small business owners who are severely affected by the lockdownPut in place the organisation that can deal with these claims and respond to them in a matter of hoursdaysCal China daily and ask them hows going on what theyre doing what they learnedSend some doctors there to see the situation on the ground learn from the Chinese doctors that already have experience with this virus and help the Chinese better deal with this shit Building some goodwill with both the Chinese gov and Chinese people wouldnt hurt That way when the virus hits locally you already have some people with experience in treating itSo much shit that could have been done I came up with this list in 510 minutes Imagine spending a couple of days thinking about this|0

We dont know that at all  Of all closed cases in the world the death rate is at 6 and hasnt dropped from that in a week now|0
The only problem that needs solving is the lack of leadership right now in America This is going to cost American lives I care more about that than the feelings or opinions of Trump supporters who will lie and make up bullshit in defense of the god emperor Ive had enough of them spewing bullshit about this being just a flu and calling the reporting of cases fakenews|0

Ive thought about if it makes sense to get out of the big city or not but it feels drastic  I could see leaving if it gets overwhelmingMy fear would be that it would spread anywhere and vying for one of the thousands of ICU beds vs trying to get one of the 8 in some rural area might be a negligible difference  Plus work consequences and the potential of not having insurance could compound issuesI will say that I wont be taking public transport and will be flying only domestically in the near short term|0
I doubt well see increases in taxes here in Denmark because of it We have a pretty healthy economy But of course the money has to come from somewhere This is just a lot better than the alternative  business going bankrupt and high unemployment This way we can hit the ground running when everything starts to get back to normal|1
I work in healthcare but not in a physician or nursing capacity and have been following everything I can since day one  I know how many people our hospital can take care of and agree that its not really out in the open if they are or arent preparing for the worstThat being said my immediate family are taking this as serious as a heart attack we have our meds stocked up non perishables and can hold up for at least 3050 days if the worst happensBut I agree no coverage in the media everything is glossed over by politics and BS  Its like they dont want anyone panicking so Im not just quietly picking up things and making sure that the most important things are safe my familyBeen in the US for over 50 years and never seen anything like this I was quarantined once as a kid due to a TB outbreak in our neighborhood 40 people on one block infectedThat seemed like childs play compared to what Im seeing in China|1

UK had its first confirmed death last Friday One of the passengers aboard the Princess Diamond|0
i had the exact same experience about 10 days ago No questions about coronavirus except if i went to China  The most fucked up part is that they ask these questions at immigration When i came there were 4 flights that came around same time so immigration had about 2 hours of waiting in those zigzag lines People were standing extremely close to each other for two hours before they were even asked about any travel history  Also out of about 500600 people in queue  only about 50 had a mask on It was fucking scary  Me n my wife discussed at that time that its going to get bad n the cases started jumping almost immediately in next week  This could have been easily prevented by some screening  planning and testing but US just didnt give a fuck at that time and is now panicking|0

We checked that me and also others looked at random case studies for eg influenza in china not in a scientific way just taking a few quick looks if the samples halfway fit with the numbers of smokers in the society They dont show that anomaly It seems to be for SARS and COVID19 onlyFor the shame factor  we asked people here on the sub from China or with China experience  from the replies which came  that doesnt exist also I worked with Chinese teams already a bit more than half a decade ago but hell they just smoke Its like the 80s in Germany in 2015 with themThen the healthcare factor  also asked Chinese or people with China experience here  health care is publicly funded and they dont care or ask at all if you smoke there are no penalties|1

It seems to affect a particular case which I imagine would mostly be newlyweds who have not yet obtained a partner visaIn most cases individuals blocked from returning to Australia with their husband or wife did not hold partner visas the couples say they were not told that was necessary to get an exemption from the travel banPersons with partner visas are permanent residents of Australia and that right can only be cancelled in very limited circumstances|0

Yes There are a lot of reports of bodies sent to crematoria to be burned immediately that had pneumonia of some sort as the cause of death but not counted as ncov though normal flu does kill a lot of people from pneumonia by its self anyway so its unlikely all the untested pneumonia deaths were ncov but certinally some were|0

I discussed the ICU situation in italy with my coworker today and he basically shrugged and said that italys healthcare is shitThis is the result of playing it down as just a bad flu Its maddening|0
It is Thats whats killing me Especially the headlines that have been saying majority of infected show almost no symptoms Was that just because they were early in infection Did symptoms ramp up daysweek laterBecause it is so novel there parallel lines of thought all over the place|0
Yea i was gonna say this is A great thought but incredibly difficult especially with the mass influx of people as well Most of these people are gonna be on LTV 1150s or others like it|1
Agreed  in many ways I was expecting cases like this about three weeks ago first week in February right after the travel ban went into effect given the fast incubation range from the first reports from Wuhan ave 5 days before symptoms appearedIt is so tricky though given what we now know with some cases of superlong incubations as well as infected people without symptoms|0

It absolutely wouldve If you look a the countries who are most able to keep COVID under control they had taken precautions much earlier than us have freeaffordable and easily accessible testing and so on These are measures we should have had been taking on a national scale much much earlier and the cutting of the CDC was a huge blow to our capacity to do this|1

No doubt Such an errie sound|0
Im kind of confused here Are they just not disclosing the total number of tests Or are they also not reporting the positive tests I cant really see any value in disclosing the total number of tests including those that come out negative because it doesnt really matter and any news site could use the total number of both positive and negative tests to get clicks However if they are withholding the data for positive tests then that shits fucked|0

This Blanket mandatory school closings will have negative consequences for all students who do not have a nonelderly guardian available to watch them at home Dualincome parents will need to pay for expensive daycare that will just reassemble large groups of kids back together again all day  no better than they were at school and possibly worse due to daycare scenarios having less age separation causing higher viral mixingWorse many of those parents unable to afford buying daycare will turn to elderly relatives to watch the kids  sending them straight to our most atrisk population Since school closures will be at least citywide if not regionwide and start on the same day it could unintentionally cause a simultaneous surge in seriously ill elderly patients overwhelming hospitals scarce resources all at the same time The elderly are most likely to present with pneumonia or ARDS requiring mechanical respirators one of our scarcest resources We really really want to avoid a synchronized wave of elderly CV19 patients all hitting city ERs at once 11 to 15 days after that city closes their schools A sudden surge of elderly patients already sliding toward ARDS was a key trigger of the Hospacolypse in early Wuhan|0

On the flip side since China has actually had pretty decent benefit from treating this thing with protease inhibitors there is atleast a slight theoretical chance that most hiv positive people who take their meds like theyre supposed to are actually functionally immune to this|1

I dont  disagree that this is seriousI was just replying to the question you posed|1
Still on the list so its still a possibility If his doctor was concerned enough to have him tested thats good enough for me|1
Except when you tie emergency unemployment benefits to testing and then have no access to testing you also have no access to unemployment benefits|0
New Rochelle is very close to Manhattan This has been spreading all over that area and has been for weeks New Rochelle is only a thing because they did some testing Wherever you do testing you are going to start finding clusters Any thought process that concludes that this is limited to a one mile radius in New Rochelle is complete lunacy More likely his move is designed to focus the spotlight and get the feds off their collective asses A brilliant move and should be applauded|1
Im honestly more surprised that everyone is surprised about this I havent trusted the government for ages now|1

Youre counting the numbers from Iran which is not listing any severe or critical cases Run your numbers again excluding Iran and you end up with 84  85 having mild symptoms  ofcourse this doesnt take into account the huge numbers of mildasymptotic cases that go undetected due to them only experiencing mild or no symptoms the real number is obviously quite a bit higher than 87 so the real severe category is probably AT MOST 5 including full blown pneumoniaIf you actually read the article you would understand that we are seeing the majority of the cases Asymptomatic doesnt mean youre asymptomatic forever According to the article most asymptomatic people developed symptoms within a day or two|1
Yes and no We know that a vaccine and effective treatment will not be available any time soon and a significant part of the of the population will eventually get COVID19 It is not necessarily a bad thing if those who are most likely to be unaffected get it sooner while a more strict lockdown of those at greater risk is in place Thats because strict lockdowns cant be held indefinitely and its better to get a much of the population infected and immune during that time That will build herd immunity so when restrictions ultimately ease those at high risk will have a better chance to survive|1

Its pretty certain at this pointThe greater question is the degree of infectiousness While you are likely to infect your close relatives the question is what probability random transmission occurs without the usual vector of coughing|1
Wait that article doesnt say how many tests have been done so far It only says how many test have been PROVIDED If you want to talk provided then US has over 75000 test kits distributed and each test kit has round 700 to 800 tests Assuming each person is tested 3 times then currently 175 million to 20 million people CAN be tested What needs to be done is we need to start testing more aggressively|0

What about the cytokine storm that can happen if a person who was vaccinated with some part of the virus gets infected with the real virus I thought that was the real problem with SARS viruses basically your immunesystem reacting to the infection in you lungs and releasing a mass of cytokines there completely obstructing your airway Do you know anything about that|0

There is a very low chance actual mortality rate is that high Look at South Koreas CFR or any other country with adequate testing And even they arent catching every single infection|1
Yeah in Canada our public health minister is telling us to stockpile food and medicationMy assumption is that theyre telling us that so we can be prepared us for lockdowns not some sort of societal collapse|0

Thanks for this too  It helps put some things in perspective  I keep flipping between sheer and utter doomsday like panic and an odd calm and comfort in believing things will be alright  Its exhausting  Im in no way downplaying the importance of self isolation and quarantines or the severity of things but damn all this panic panic buying and people screaming into the void that is the internet has made me relapse the hardest I ever had since being on medication and therapy  Hope you are well|0

The CFR for people under 40 is about 02 They also are less likely to need ICU support  4049 is about 04 5059 about 10  cant remember how it rises from there but its near 10 for people over 80  So if you can keep enough of the elderly safe you can easily get the CFR  1Secondly  CFR is case fatality rate  The question is how many people get infected but never get enough symptoms to become an actual case  Its likely there are quite a lot of them particularly amongst the young  As I understand it the government thinks theres really a lot of them  enough to reduce the actual load by a factor of 10100 The 10100 here is my uncertainty of what the government thinks  That seems to be by far the riskiest assumption to meTo be clear even it all works I think theyve traded lives for a speedy return to normality  I think we could have just kept the numbers down as several countries in Asia have managed  Im not a supporter of this plan  But it may not be quite as batshit insane as it looks|0

Right the study is useful I am not saying its not The data inside of it is valuable just the conclusions will often be messy The problem is with studies the conclusions they give are entirely based on the study itself They do not say the R0 is this they say the research of this study would indicate an estimated R0 of this based on the data provided There are tons of different studies giving wildly different R0 figures from reputable organizations around the world They use different methods and different ways of calculating this None of them are going to claim that THEY are the absolute correct study because that isnt how science works especially epidemiology for a virus we dont fully understand I am sure if you asked the conductors of that study if they believe it is the correct figure they would tell you they dont know Its just the numbers they put in But these numbers are based on vague estimates and vague timelines We dont know if there were already 20000 cases by January 1st or if there were 2000 cases and it rapidly grew to 75000 cases by January 27th when the 75k estimate was given We dont know if it slowly grew over the 2 months it was withheld from the public or very suddenly grew We dont know if its actually 75k on january 27th or 150k or 30k etc We dont know and neither did the study They used estimates This is a very misleading way to calculate an R0 for a virus where we simply dont have the correct numbers at all|1
Humanities yes STEM no STEM programs in Korea are conducted in English as a part of its globalization effort I attend Seoul National University with friends in other universities across the countey as well Doctors will know both Korean and English terms for diseases and symptoms and will most likely be proficient in English as well Korean education on Chinese characters has been gradually phased out since the early 2000s in favor of making English the requisite secondary language|1

Right now the fatality rate in the UK is much lower although this will likely change rapidly Not everyone is being tested but 10K people are estimated to have covid19  There are 35 confirmed deaths so the rate stands at 035 mortality and most had comorbiditiesOddly youve selected emotive examples where each person was murdered These are not risk stats because they are entirely retrospective and are not applied to any realworld prediction modelAlso you have closed with the Shipman analogy even though most people still take public transport in periods of elevated terror threat levels There is a subjective element to risk assessment which we calculate relative to our own concern of the spatial and temporal proximity of risk factors that we can identify 800 commuters only concerns the trains at Kings Cross at that time Well millions of people commute by rail You can endlessly broaden and narrow the pool by different categories to arrive at a stat thats convenient|0
I mean when the number of test kit is low it makes sense to only test the ones that are already sick and have the symptoms I dont think you can draw conclusions either way|0

Its far better than america lol Ever since the government clamped down on it most sick ppl has had either paid leave by either work or government the people government and industry remember SARS over hereIn america people die because they couldnt go to the doctor when they get a flu lol|0
Just be careful Ive heard a lot of people exhibiting symptoms then they feel better then the symptoms ramp up I hope youre ok but selfisolate for at least a few days to make sure youre not a carrier Its the asymptomatic carriers who are the super spreaders|1
That is truly disturbing No evidence that they were intentionally wrong|0
Then everyone that person has come into contact with in the last few daysweek can be tested Theres also a large fraction of people who get CV without presenting any symptoms That person can get a bunch of people sick without knowing This is why we need to make these tests more available|0

Right there with you I have just 5 N95 masks I took from work yesterday But from what Im understanding if you can smell a person their breath then its possible to be breathing in microscopic viral particles Even these masks may only reduce by 50 I know Id be beside myself in this crowded situation but at least maybe hold a handkerchief scarf anything to reduce inhaling particles And like most of us were all learning this week to week day by day|1

I believe the South Korean numbers are reasonably current health authorities are providing an update twice a day which is tracked and summarized by BNOhttpsbnonewscomindexphp202002thelatestcoronaviruscases with source links to the original reportsWe do have another example where the outbreak has possibly run its course already China and it is reporting similarly low hospitalization rates and fatality rates as the South Korean numbers are trending to but with 6 weeks more data and with just a trickle of new cases new daily infections in nonHubei China are down to 008 of all patients under treatment|0

Okay a little bit of an update here   Upper Schools in Sweden have closed and we are gonna have live lessons instead Im very happy about that  Problem is that my dad is a teacher And he works in middle school where they still havent closed Im still afraid for him but I will at least hopefully not cause an infection now Hopefully Sweden comes through with closing all schools apparently they also took an uturn when Britain did   We have had 8 deaths so far which in my opinion is 8 too much     I am doing grocery shopping now via bus because I am still 16 Luckily my parents have been stacking up for a couple of weeks now so we are kind of covered in that area dont worry we didnt buy 234552352352 stocks of toilet paper  Hand sanitizer is the only thing we are out of because there isnt any to buy anymore   My last concern now is my hospital visits I had a surgery a while ago and have a wound that needs to be cleaned 34 times a week I am from now on going with a balaclava when I visit the hospital There are no face masks left anywhere so that kind of a dead end   Sweden still hasnt taken any more necessary actions apart from closing the schools I am afraid that we could end up in a similar case as Italy Something our hospitals definitely cant handle   Otherwise we talk in our family a lot Im now away from the center and will avoid going out at all costs Vitamins are something I will look to buy though thanks for the advice everyone It really helped|1

As someone in the sexuality education world Ive been waiting for it to hit The Villages Their STI outbreaks are infamous for their severity and how challenging it is to get people both in and out of the community to take them seriously The fact that The Villages is overwhelmingly politically conservative and a cornerstone of GOP support in the state likely kept them from taking preventative measures sooner given the Presidents rhetoric only a week ago My 80yr old father and step mother live in a retirement community near Orlando and I doubt itll be long before they start seeing cases too|0

Besides the point Pneumonia or not its not a guarantee to get permanent damage its all speculation Lets wait for solid evidence on it Not saying your wrong but its also a fact that alot of the people in china that were tested with stars back then were smokers and or had damage from pollution in the area But again were just speculating speculation is whats driving fear|0
Well I look past hard facts If the US military operated on 100 facts I would be dead 500 times over Operationally you need to infer things and take action or you die You are the type of person that did not believe person to person transmission was possible until the 23rd when China said it or are you like some at the CDC and still sat its only close personal contact|0
Reddit and American journalists dont understand planning ahead thoughThats why they wrote so many stories on Chinese ghost cities when they couldnt comprehend that the country was dealing with rural to urban migration of 25000000 people per year because over the past 20 years the country has gone from 20 living in cities to 50|0

People seem desperate to keep the old and preexisting conditions thing going despite only being confirmed by 1 Chinese reportWell see how it holds up but personally Im waiting for more reliable data The anecdotal evidence doesnt look good though|0
Im not sure what the percentages are but if I had to guess Id say that most people in America only know one reality America  Thats their frame of reference  When they hear the news about things happening on the other side of the world they think it doesnt concern them  They look around life seems normal and they go on about their business  And for some reason the media and the government seem to be encouraging this attitude  Its just the flu  It only affects old people  They dont understand that thousands of people fly into the USA every day from all parts of the world  They dont understand things like asymptomatic transmission and they certainly dont understand the exponential function|1

Its also about not trusting WHO at the onset admittedly over a tiff about not recognising nation status and not being a recipient of WHO data  a tendency to be suspicious of anything coming out from China hence early travel ban and having technocrats like Tsai law Prof and Veep Chen ChienJen former epidemiologist and health minister during the 2003 Sars outbreak who listen to their science people and act fast on good adviceNow imagine if the current Coronavirus had happened during the Obama administration|0

Ive talked to several Korean friends in Korea  We agree that Koreas response has been terrific but when compared directly to Italys death rate we think theres some luck involved as well  Koreas serious outbreak and response started with some lady infecting members of some religious sect  Most members of that sect are allegedly younger 20s30s  So the initial wave of sick were younger but Korea realized this was going to get serious and immediately moved to address COVID19If say this hadnt happened and instead this thing wasnt identified as serious until a bunch of old people in nursing homes were getting sickdying this may have overwhelmed hospitals from the beginning the elderly are not only more likely to die but also to need hospital careMy impression is this is what happened in Italy  COVID19 really began being identified as a major issue when a lot of people started dying from it and this is going to be mostly the elderly so by the time measures were being taken to address this early critical mass of sickdying elderly overwhelmed the hospital system  I think this is somewhat what happened here in the USA  People really started paying attention domestically when a lot of people started dying in that nursing home in the Seattle area|0
The panicked will clean out the shelves I suggest stocking up nowWell luckily the US produces a lot locally thanks to mass agriculture  Hopefully we can take advantage of all that food wheat corn  milk that is usually wasted and maybe we can spend the mass amounts of subsidies that goes to farms on testingTransportation is an issue  But Im sure that mass starvation wont happen especially since farm workers in theory are isolated and more protected from COVID|1
As someone who obsesses over the flu Im pretty confident in my hygiene  I cant work from home but I can lock myself in my office with limited exposure to others for about 85 of my work day and in my contact with others its for short spurts where I cant be pretty vigilant about being safe  But I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old so I will probably end up catching it from them ifwhen it spreads|1

I seriously doubt that the 30 death from Washington state is a big enough sample size that this extrapolation holds There are also significant differences in the population and environment between Washington state and Wuhan both in terms of density health pollution and probably a million other factors that will play into the relationship between current number of death and actual infected countUntil we get way more testing done we will have no idea how fucked we are yep I live in King County in WA so right in the shit show|0
Seattle has 10 dead  There have to be over 400 with the virus not 39 like they have tested  That is a lot of people and many will  go to work for fear of losing jobs or because they dont have benefits|0

Thats one in 2500 families Given the scale of the virus and the fact that death rate is about twice the national average in Wuhan the 2 figure is plausibleIn reality the chance is even higher because people in the same household share risk factors je if one parent didnt get early treatment probably the other didnt either|0

The procedures are discussed both on this subreddit and elsewhere eg contact tracing testing of those in contact with those infected and sentinel testing I dont exactly think that you or I are qualified to determine what appropriate measures are nor do either of us have access to the required data to totally understand the impacts of various potential strategiesIf you want to know more go read public health Canada and the WHOs outputIm also not confident and neither are the epidemiologists I agree with them that containment will eventually fail at which point the impact of stronger measures will need to be compared to the impact of more rapid viral spread I assume much of this work is actually underway|0

There arent any tougher measures then what China has been taking the past few weeks Were just seeing that experts were always right in saying that mass quarantine isnt effective The only thing that is effective is catching it early and finding every single possible contact within the first few weeks of the outbreak and monitoring them in isolation Once you get 3 to 4 phases out from the first patient its all about mitigation as containment becomes impossible at that scale|0

I guess you have no information on how socalled health insurance  works in the USA   Its like this you pay every month they collect  You fall sick you have to pay your deductible so you pay everything yourself  Same the second and third time of the year because the deductible is annual   Then when uou have covered your deductible and its time for them to pay they find excuses  For example its a pandemic Or preexistent condition Before Obamacare and in the future when republican judicial challenges finally bring obamacare down  I agree with you that these miserable POS shouldnt be allowed to call themselves health insurance  but in the US they do|0

In the US there was no need to rapid build hospitals Weve known about this since at least January Experts have been sounding the alarm the whole time We could have been mass producing masks and other gear while setting up medical centers and advancing testing tech Instead we are currently the nation that tests the least and we have no idea what we are going to do with the massive surplus of infected people about to hit our hospitals We havent even heard of one state trying to put together a single medical center The leaders seem to be the least informed of all of us|0
Right  46 weeks ago many of us were reading and growing concerned about the spread in China We noticed stores near us with N95s on the shelf  Why would we not buy these masks  The CDC was not going store to store buying out the supply   If we didnt buy them our neighbor down the street would   The CDC proving how incompetent they are is really frightening|0

They sure are important If we trigger the next great depression that will likely kill more people than the virus I have no idea how this is all going to work If there is no major medical breakthrough soon all the best minds are going to have to figure out the leastawful medium and longterm plans for dealing with this situation Maybe will will have to quarantine everyone over 60 or with preexisting conditions for the next year or two Maybe we can expose small groups of people at a time It will likely be a very difficult and controversial process figuring out the way forward from here|0

Can you explain then why South Korea seems able to test thousands per day but the CDC cant seem to manage more than a few and takes days to confirm It looks like the mighty US has the worst detection capabilities in the whole Asia PacificItaly seems to be doing a better job as well  Is this bungling bureaucrats or is the CDC being a control freak to justify its fundingIt seems inconceivable that the situation can be so poor but if it is why can they not buy tests from Korea or Japan I believe Hawaii is wanting to buy some from Japan but have not been permitted|0

Figured Id post one of my replies to you since youre more educated in this topic than most in this subMaybe Im wrong but doesnt this only apply to viruses that require symptoms to spread and cant spread during incubation If the current incubation period is say 7 days that is more than enough time to spread from person to person before symptoms show If the virus mutates and the symptoms become deadlier that is a recipe for disaster|0

How contiguous the 2019nCoV is in other countries remains to be seen If the value of R0 is as high in other countries our results suggest that active and strong populationwide social distancing efforts such as closing down transportation system schools discouraging travel etc might be needed to reduce the overall contacts to contain the spread of the virus|1
 When you read the German 9 mild linked patient study how do you interpret what they say about antibodiesIts a small sample size with a lot of pretty deep virology discussion of directional hypotheses and possibilities which as a nonvirologist is beyond what Im comfortable commenting on This seems like one key conclusion these findings suggest a more efficient transmission of SARSCoV2 than SARSCoV through active pharyngeal viral shedding at a time when symptoms are still mild and typical of upper respiratory tract infectionWhich I think is more confirmation that CV19 spreads better and earlier than SARS but is substantially less lethal in healthy patients As for antibodies they find in their sample that they reliably appear 612 days after infection unlike SARS which was not as reliable Thats great news for an eventual serological test being effective which will help us get an idea of just how many people have been infected by this thing  even after theyve recovered|1

This is nonsensical The flu kills more people than this because this is brand new hence the novel Your second sentence The difference they believe is this is contagious before one shows symptoms Dude no The incubation period of the flu is about 2 days but varies between 1 and 4 days The incubation period is the period of time between infection and showing symptoms Influenza is contagious during the incubation period|0
January 100 of cases are travellers who brought the virus back  February 90 of cases are travellers who brought the virus back  March 74 of cases are travellers who brought the virus back  2 weeks later Well were seeing some evidence of community spread but the risk is very low  1 month later Oh shit  BuT tRaVeL BaNs DoNt WoRk|0

So that would mean that all reported cases come from 14 of those infected But were treating those 14 as 100 and using that to extrapolate data So when you hear 10 of all cases require hospitalization that number is 10 of 14 Heres a better breakdownFirst lets assume we have a population of 100 Under current data models were saying that 10 of those infected require hospitalization That is then being used to say If you get the virus you have a 10 chance of going to the hospitalAssuming that 10 out of 100 will be hospitalized is wrong Based on this report those 100 people 86 people will not be symptomatic They wont know they are sick and go about their lives It should be noted this is very common for many viruses and illnesses Our immune systems are very good at their jobWe are then basing mortality on incorrect data Were assuming 5 of all infected will die That would be 5 out of 100 based on this report the real data is this 14 of the 100 will have symptoms they feel are worthy to report From that number 10 may require hospitalization  or 14 people 5 may die 7 peopleWhen looked at this way the differences are startling It is 14 people100 hospitalized not 10100 and 7 people100 dead not 5100 Of course these will still result in large numbers but they arent end of the world numbers They are bad flu season numbers Take common sense precautions and shield those at risk but please stop the panic|0

I think one of the things you have to first is to quarantine yourself and contact the hotline Avoid public transport at all costThe worst thing which can happen if you dont have it is just a trip to the hospital The worst thing if you do have it would be endangering not only yourself by letting your symptoms run late without detection but also endangering others by infecting them|0

I dont believe the logic of having an ill prepared population who thinks this is just the flu as so many others including Trump just said This is NOT the flu and if people arent preparing and havent been for months like they should have been there will be runs on groceries and goods when it breaks out like it almost certainly will Instead of the calm buying and prepping people like me have been doing for months already The jobs will be gone anyway if companies start losing money The retirement funds will be gone or hit hard and instead of it just being gone they could have spent it on useable goods to weather this coming storm This isnt Y2K or whatever This is something that will disrupt the world greater than any single event in my life|1

The lady was a nurse she talks about when she first got sick In all of the segments she does not mention that she still has long term issues from SARS  The other woman narrator later says that the interesting thing about the SARS virus is that it just went away  I watched all the segments where the nurse was interviewed  She doesnt mention long term effects Can someone give the timecode where they talk about long term effectsNetflix aside I do see sources that say that there are documented long term effects from SARS For example Although the longterm physical effects of Sars  including bone necrosis  are well documented the psychological effects are less well understood Many otherwise healthy adults are still suffering mental trauma as a result of the infection  with media and public interest in the 10th anniversary of the crisis forcing some to relive their ordealSource httpswwwscmpcomnewshongkongarticle1203389tenyearsmentalandphysicalscarssarsAlso see httpswwwthestarcomlifehealthwellness20100902sarssurvivorsstrugglewithsymptomsyearslaterhtml|0

Well the world isnt black and white Its always gonna be a mix of technical problems and political problems The reason people tends to assume the worst for China because many of us have had experiences or have heard stories from our parents or relatives with how the CCP functions and it further reinforces that way of thinking when more often than not China makes headlines because they have done some politically shady businessesThat is not to say its nice to assume things because it isnt But its also not a bad idea to keep vigilant when it comes to someone or some organization that you are well aware has a pretty bad track recordIts true that there is always gonna be a technical difficulty with identifiying every single case in an epidemic especially when it is as fast spreading as this one But its also true the CCP has full control how many tests get to be done nation wide in China and that they are doing a horrible job providing as much medical needs to its people as possible and the corruptions from their government and aid organizations run by them such as Red Cross in China further exacerbated the severity of the situation and the lack of medical supplies to the front lineJust dont say we didnt warn you and later regret giving them too much benefit of the doubt when things blow over The warning signs have been around since like forever People who knows Chinese and have read news and information leak from social media from the east already left a lot of bread crumbs for the western audiences to trace Its your own decision if you want to actually pick them up|1

I was one of the screeners at LAX all we could do was look for active symptoms ask about travel history and take current temperature Its not like we could run blood tests on every passenger coming from China Most we could do is quarantine those with red flags and tell the rest that appeared healthy to monitor their health the next two weeks but its infectious during its incubation period which makes this virus particularly tricky and survives on surfaces for I believe up to a week|0
Italians doing a good job Russia for example is ignoring it completely Im from Russia I know how people and government here work Russia is Chinas backyard and has no infected BS they just say its just a flu Guess the only way to really know what is happening here is when total collapse of hospitals will happen Also funny thing Chinas latest numbers are just lol such an obvious BS|0
It doesnt work like that never works like that and simply couldnt work like that You dont get out much|0
Theres nothing hypocritical about their actions if you understand that their primary concern should be the wellbeing both health and economically of their own people And their recommendations to other countries should also reflect what is best for the Chinese peopleSo no they have not been hypocritical in that endeavor They have been quite consistent|1
Also it would need to kill sooner to wipe itself out  14 days incubation then another few days to die allows the virus a lot of time to reach more contacts  Also can be picked up on surfaces for up to 9 days|0
I was VERY sick the past two weeks More sick than Ive been in a long timeCouldnt get out of bed high fevers it was bad and spread through our house fast My son is the one who got me sick and Im pretty sure he caught it from Disneyland I was honestly surprised that when I took him to his drs appointment nothing was checked for Corona it was never mentioned or brought up I explained we were at Disneyland where so many Chinese tourists are at and it wasnt even acknowledged I was expecting some kind of test to rule it out|0
Thats not wrong its just incomplete It can live in the air for 3 hours on glass for 3 DAYS and again it cant be stated enough that people can shed the virus before they have symptoms and after they have recovered I dont work for WHO or anything but I would be shocked if the US doesnt lock everything down with curfews and law enforcement to keep people from travelling Its so contagious Thats the only way we will get this under control|0
Fwiw i dont think theyre deliberately lying I just dont think the medical infrastructure is incapable of handling this|0

You call it a fear bubble and I call it basic common sense I am already doing my part by avoiding the public except for grocery store trips when needed I do my part by washing hands not touching things unless needed covering my mouth when I sneeze or cough These are basics I have done for 5 years due to immunocompromised children One because I do not want to catch anything and give it to my children but I also do not want to spread the many illnesses my kids pick up Again basic common sense I do not expect anything It is clear my government is not taking this seriously Slowing the spread of infection is key and they are doing absolutely nothing about it I would hope that another human would care about another persons life regardless of if they personally know them I do Why is it so hard for some people to think outside themselves The actions of someone leaving the country to a widely community spread area is selfish unless they stay there Their little trip could result in multitudes of people infected and loss of life Its pure selfishness|0

So here are the basic facts of this pandemic It spreads like crazy It transmits through droplets so when you cough and sneeze If someone coughs at their hand touches a handle or a surface etc the virus can live on the surface for days on end longer in a coder climate but still multiple days in higher temperatures You can be infected with it carry it around with you and still not have any symptoms On average people show symptoms after 7 days sometimes up to 14 days or even more This virus attacks your lungs 8090 of the confirmed cases of peopel who got it showed mild symptoms high fever headache trouble breathing and cough Sounds good ight Well the remaining 1020 need hospita l ICU beds oxygen and medical vetilators to survive Their lungs fill up with liquid and they need the artificial help Sine this is very novel we have no built up immunity to it and no vaccines So medical professionals need to wear PPE personal protective equipment full get up So medical personnel are at great risk here of getting the sickness which would force them to quarantinex200BAll of these factors mean that the Coronavirus spreads quickly and sneakily A massive amount of people will show up needin need emergency ICU beds medical equipment personal attention from a nurse who in turn needs t o be wearing perfect protective gear and so on In Wuhan and Italy weve seen the hospital system come close to collapse How do you think the US will fare|0

Yes Thank you Im in south OC My husband said over the wknd a good amount of shoppers in Costco were wearing masks and he saw others in the community yesterday so Im glad people are taking precautions Im wearing gloves when I go out in public I think America is quickly realizing how much we touch that everyone does too gas pumps door handles in stores to freezersfridges etc Im just saving my disinfectant spray and using disposable gloves when I go out|1
Exactly  What is the false negativepositive rate of people who are actually tested  What  of people presenting symptoms that havent traveled to China are being tested  The R0 changes the period of incubation keeps expanding  I want to believe that there isnt a single case in South America or Africa outside of Egypt or NYC  That would be fantastic but it just doesnt seem possible|1
Unfortunately reports are not conflicting  Someone caught it by entering a bus 30 minutes after an infected person departed and didnt touch any common surfaces  The virus lived in the air in that bus for at least 30 minutes  httpswwwscmpcomnewschinasciencearticle3074351coronaviruscantraveltwicefarofficialsafedistanceandstay    There was also a paper published that showed it remaining active in an aerosol for 3 hours their study ended after 3 hours it may have lasted even longer  httpswwwmedscapecomviewarticle926929|0

Obviously nothing about CV19 is good news in a literal sense What I should have said is more like maybe less bad Most current models of CV19 based largely on Wuhan estimates present a range of possibilities that include a goodsized chunk of pretty damn bad This new data enables an alternate hypothesis with a range of possibilities that include a goodsized chunk of less bad IMHO Potentially far less than your a likley death rate of arround 1 note death rate isnt clearly defined more useful to stick to defined terms like CFR and IFR to prevent confusion|0

Chinas Communist Party leader Xi Jinping issued internal orders about the coronavirus epidemic in early January about two weeks before his first public remarks on the outbreak according to a speech by Mr Xi that was published Saturday The speech confirmed for the first time that he was aware of the virus while officials at its epicenter were openly downplaying its dangersIn the speech Mr Xi said that he had initially given orders about the coronavirus outbreak on Jan 7 during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee the Communist Partys topmost body That places Mr Xis involvement with fighting the epidemic earlier than previously known Mr Xis earliest public comment on the epidemic was Jan 20 when he gave brief instructions on the issue that were published by state mediaIn early January leaders in Wuhan the city at the epicenter of the outbreak were giving open assurances that there was no clear evidence of humantohuman transmission Mr Xi did not disclose details of his instructions on Jan 7 but it seems clear that Wuhan officials would have known that the countrys top leader was paying attention to the outbreakThe evidence that Mr Xi was addressing the spread of the coronavirus earlier than previously known has now been released apparently in an effort to show that he has commanded the fight against the epidemic  notwithstanding rumors that he let others take the leadADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main story The speech in which Mr Xi described his initial involvement in countering the spread of the coronavirus was published by Qiushi or Seeking Truth the Communist Partys top doctrinal journal Mr Xi gave the speech on Feb 3 when the coronavirus was spiraling into a national crisis for China prompting the lockdown of Wuhan and other hardhit cities in Hubei Province and a chain reaction of restrictions across other parts of the countryMr Xi is a dominant figure in Chinese politics and his utterances are treated as lodestones by officials Here are some other main points from the newly published Feb 3 speechMr Xi in charge Mr Xi emphasized that he has been constantly involved in decisions about the crisis and he indicates that he gave the authorization to put Wuhan and other areas of Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown from Jan 23 In the speech Mr Xi recalled I clearly demanded that Hubei Province exercise comprehensive strict control over the outflow of individualsYou have 4 free articles remaining Subscribe to The Times Two focal points in a nationwide peoples war Mr Xi describes the effort to end the epidemic as an allencompassing peoples war across China But he singles out two key battlegrounds Hubei Province where the infections and deaths have been concentrated and Beijing the national capital Beijing has a special status Mr Xi told the meeting He said Strengthen management and control of key populationsControlling the narrative Mr Xi stresses the importance of preserving social stability through easing public fear providing adequate supplies of food and other needs and demonstrating confidence that the epidemic can be beaten And he also emphasizes winning over public opinion at home and abroad There must be closer monitoring and assessment of opinion proactively speaking out and giving positive guidance Mr Xi said of Chinese public sentiment Seize the initiative and effectively shape international opinion he added Tell well the story of Chinas fight against the epidemicADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main story Coping with economic damage Mr Xi acknowledges that the epidemic and fight to curtail it will drag on Chinas economy by putting pressure on industry especially smaller firms by slowing construction projects and by cooling domestic and foreign trade In response Mr Xi said the government will provide financial support for businesses help migrant workers return to their jobs when production resumes and step up support for projects He also said the blow to consumer spending could be offset by encouraging spending in new areas such as 5G phone networks as well as online entertainment and education He also encouraged areas across China to lower restrictions on car purchases|1

Im pretty sure that the lung damage would go handin with symptoms Lung scarring would only be possible if the person were in a state of having actual respiratory problemsAlso AFAIK the long term lung damage thing is pretty uncorroborated Pneumonia can occasionallyhttpswwwbreathingmatterscoukpneumonia but not often cause some amount of lung damage The Hong Kong study being circulated around here recently was looking at only 12 people and among them only 2 to 3 had signs of damagethough hard to say how permanent or long term that is considering it had only been a few weeks since infection|0

Absolutely Demographics are critical when discussing the fatality rateIf youre interested heres a comment I made about the outbreak in South KoreaThe current fatality rate in Korea is 065 Some important information to better understand why this may beThe below applies to Daegu the epicenter of the outbreak representing about 45 of all cases in SK only  Of those infected 380 are in their 20s This is a reflection of the younger demographic of the Shincheonji cult 137 are in their 40s and 183 are in their 50s  only 6 of the infected are 70 for reference here is the age distribution of South Korea httpswwwindexmundicomgraphspopulationpyramidssouthkoreapopulationpyramid2018jpg 23 of the infected are women 34 of the infected in Daegu are from the Shincheonji cult 1760 are hospitalized Over 90 of cases are unresolved at this timeOverall this provides a possible explanation for the relatively low mortality rate weve seen from Korea thus far According to worldometers women are less likely to die from COVID19 likely correlating with a lower prevalence of vascular conditions and smoking historySourcehttpsblognavercomdaegunews221840129905|0

its also 100 incorrect You have no immunity to it that is exactly the definition of novel you have never encountered it before you have no existing antibodies for it etc having no immunity means that if the virus gets inside your body and touches the right protein you WILL get infected immunity would suggest that your body would detect and immediately know how to destroy the virus upon encountering it in your body preventing you from getting sick that doesnt happen  you get it inside you it DOES replicateyou DO however have an immune response to it that means your body notices when it starts replicating and starts fighting against it you are capable of building an immunity to it that is again not the same of having immunity to it to start immunity means wont catch it not wont die from it|0

I work for a company that hires college students to reduce their student debt and we do the work for major clients doing their call center work glad we can attempt to collect your credit card debt during a crisis were located close to a few campuses in the US Since we are a call cent off depending on which client we work for we have over 50100 students and management in each small production area We had students who traveled from spring break to outbreak areas and although our company is sanitizing every night providing sanitizer and wipes every time sits on top of each other and is instructed to come to work unless you are exposed you are to remain working If you are exposed us students will lose our pay and probably our tax free tuition assistance which is the biggest reason we work here The supervisors would have to use whats left of their PTO and thats it and most of them have kids but they are doing their best to keep us calm and wipe things and I feel like they are just as in a tough position as we are because they cant afford to lose their job Normally its a good company but the fact that Arizona isnt taking this as seriously in part as our whole company isnt putting in enough effort to protect us|1

Management gave us a bottle of windex and told us to dust shit So we would take paper rolls and clean everything but never the display units because management never checked those They were also so heavily used they just didnt have dust build up Sure we would windex computer screens Which is a no no because it ruins the coatings lol  for dust but thats itThinking back now its kinda ironicdisgusting lol They would do the finger swipe test on hidden crooks for dust so we would diligently cleandust weird areas  everything but the stuff that customers would touchuseYikes|0

Thank you for sharing this Ive been thinking for a long time that the 3day median incubation period reported in the past was probably incorrect In fact my impression from looking at some examples of transmission chains coming from Germany Singapore and China was that this period was often longer than 3 days Ive actually posted a comment about this in this sub that was later removed by upat000pathttpswwwredditcomuserpat000pat because it contained unsourced speculation The comment readI have this ongoing suspicion that the  reported median contagion time of 3 days from that China study with 1k  patients is really an underestimate Its probably very hard to do  contract tracing of so many people especially when most of them are  already in a serious enough condition to be admitted to hospital    Furthermore we know from the Tokyo cruise experiment that the  disease is highly contagious and that even after all this time we are  still getting reports of new positive cases from there So now lets  imagine this scenario everyone in Wuhan is sick before  quarantine is imposed People stay mostly at home with their families  In a given household someone starts showing symptoms After a couple of  days someone else in that household starts showing symptoms as well  The naive assumption would be that this second person was infected from  the first one given an estimate for the incubation period of only a few  days This is obviously an incorrect interpretation of the situation  but its the only estimate they have and presumably the one that was  registered for the purposes of that study    This also makes me thing that the narrative that things in China are  getting better is a complete fabrication People know not to trust  their numbers but many assume that they at least reflect a real trend  Im not sure thats the case As Ive pointed here    httpsnpredditcomrCOVID19commentsf5bhxcthisisthenewreportthatwasreferencedatthefhy96awcontext3httpswwwredditcomrCOVID19commentsf5bhxcthisisthenewreportthatwasreferencedatthefhy96awcontext3    the number of new cases started to plateaudecline too fast after quarantine was imposed And the comment that I was referring to readTheres something about the data plotted in Fig 3Bhttpweeklychinacdccnenarticleide53946e2c6c441e99a9bfea8db1a8f51 that looks a bit  fishy to me We know that Wuhan entered quarantine on January 23 and  that the rest of Hubei and parts of China entered it later Since the  incubation period is relatively long we should expect to see some lag  between the date when the quarantine was declared and real effects in  terms of symptoms on the spread of the disease However in this  figure we see that the symptom onset for the confirmed cases started  dropping almost immediately after Jan 23|0

This is estimated between Spanish flu and the 50s flu outbreak So yeah Sounds ballparkId dig up the source but you could probably Google that and Ive spent most of the day reading watching reading more thinking about thisIm gonna tap out for the night on virii I think and think about clouds or fucking leaves or kittensEdit I think I pulled that random factoid from the Bill Gates piece published earlier today|0

they can pull resources from other regions because the infection in those regions are not as serious as Hubei I fear the situation in France and German is no better than in Italy|0
I mean if we are using Italy as a baseline for transparency and they have reported that most deaths in elderly with underlining conditions we can probably take this video with a grain of saltNow anyone of any age can die of pneumonia we arent immune to it  Also those entering a critical state are more likely to do die 50 if she didnt get care or breathing assistance then yeah you are going to die|0

Maybe the Chinese tourists left when they heard about the preannounced quarantine and headed to Italy   I know I saw reports about a couple that traveled through Italy  Perhaps some of the Asian cruises were there after it broke out in China but before it was so widely understood just how bad things wereYou say you blocked travel on 0130    It broke out in China end of November and was not on the radar until 0101 and Wuhan and others were not quarantined until 0124So there are many ways it could have arrived  This thing is a silent spreader until the tipping point is reached   It is more than likely there have been cases there for 6 weeks but they were not recognized as COVID19 or the cases were all mild and people just thought they had the flu   THere are accounts of people out there that are positve and they are saying the feel absolutely fine mild cough but no fever and have walking pneumonia which you dont even know you have which is why they call it walking pnemonia because you can still carry on with your daytodaySo in short my answer is they likely got there beforeyou closed the borders    Even if that is not the case closing the borders would not prevent all the cases as there are ways around it but Isuspect my first answer is more accurate|0

I dont know how it works in the UK but I think in China SK and Singapore theyre able to use the cellphone GPS data and figure out exactly who was sitting in which section of the stadium which makes the tracking problem much easier China also went a lot further than just banning large gatherings locking people in their housesI read an article a while back suggesting that loose quarantines worked better during the 1918 Spanish Flu than tight quarantines because people are afraid of getting locked up so they avoid doctors and authorities and deny being sick In the non locked down cities the sick people went to the doctors for advice got told to stay home in bed and generally did that Food for thought|0

A small note about the exported cases from Italy They are expected to be a lot higher than South Korea just by virtue of where the outbreak is Northern Italy is a major tourist destination and most cases you have now in Europe were people vacationing in Italy While in South Korea the cluster is a lot more localized Firstly mostly people related to the cult are infected and secondly Daegu is not a major tourist destination in Korea Therefore the export of cases should be a lot higherAlthough I do agree it seems that Italys cases should still be a lot higher From the last numbers I remember Korea tested about 5 times as many people as Italy 164k vs 32k So judging from the tests Korea tested 37 positive while in Italy it is 12|1

How has that worked out 15 trillion printed last week Interest rates drop to 025 and even with that banks lose 1020 of their stock value in one dayYoure advocating for trickle down care of a countrys citizens Give the money to the corporations and make sure they help out their employees If a company is valued at 3 or 10 billion dollars they should be prepared for this instead of movingkeeping their cash offshore and taking all the profits instead of putting it into a piggy bank Weve been told each of us as citizens should already have a 2 week emergency supply but while the airlines are making billions they now dont have any money in the bank to float their business during times like these and now you want the useless government to prop up these falsely valued corpsFiscal conservative argues to trickle down trillions of dollars to corporations instead of giving it to the people As Roger Waters says You think youre a laugh but youre really a cry|1

Im not sure who this is directed but I wasnt saying a 5000 bandaid to be part of any oop max Its really not theoretical no regulation and its a big part of the problem My point being a provider doctor clinic or hospital is free to charge any amount they want Example being the pt in surgery and the primary surgeon getting a consult The consulting doc charges 10k for 5 minutes of time true example Leaving the pt to fight the charge Unless the pt has read carefully the releases and noted and struck these includes theres really not much legal recourse|0
No|0
I have one BIG question about hygiene including what works to help protect yourself wash your hands As nearly everyone uses a smart phone I am wondering whether the phones do not carry a lot of germs and viruses as wellWould it not be also very important to do one of these two thingsa disinfect ones smart phone every time one washes his hands what is the best agent for this is alcoholbased glass cleaner good b Not use smart phone outside of ones own home which I personally find easier|1

I have multiple friends in New York right now on spring break riding the subway every day and going to Broadway shows with packed houses every night Theyre just having the time of their life sharing it with everyone on FB and this weekend theyre all flying back home Judging by those packed houses there are almost certainly tons of people from every major urban area in the country doing this and about to head back home to their respective cities Nobody is taking this seriously or fully understanding how fast this spreads Weve probably already passed the point of critical mass|1
Good point If no outbreak in a week then I think their strategy is working Theyve lasted longer than like half the nations on earth I like their odds for waiting it out over the remaining uninfected nations|1

You can say itTheres a huge detachment from the idea of Western and Eastern cultures Theres probably some racism boiled in there but even in the way we describe the nations you can see that we still dont acknowledge them correctlyWhich should have scared you even moreYoure exactly right I acknowledged a self contradiction But in the absence of good evidence I decided to just wait for more information  It could be that the infection totals were way higher which would have brought the fatality rate way down Or it could be that BOTH were way higher which would have brought everything up   And because Im not in a position of power theres not really any control over what to do about it except how much I want to let it affect my blood pressureThats why I said reflect on that a little bit Maybe deep down people dont really care about other races as much as they think they areWell Id like to stop you there because I think youre digging into the same bag when proximity and relatability make more senseDoes racism play into how we understand Eastern and African peoples and Nations as The Other  Of course 100 But let me posit this to youWhen are you more worried   When you hear about a fire happening When you can see smoke on the horizon When you can see an uncontrolled blaze in the distance When a wall of flame is overtaking your neighbors houseClearly each of these stages is alarming and there might be action to take  But to say that I only care about my neighbor burning because of their race doesnt get to the heart of itSomewhere inside I dont really care about my neighbor  I care that Im next Primal self preservation instinct makes more sense than racism in this caseBut introspection is important in all cases and its not like Im saying its okay that it took people so long to get scared and take it seriouslyIm just saying that theres a point where something becomes more than a perceived threat it becomes a real threat  And that moment for many people has come this week Rightly or wrongly each for our own reasons|0

The hospital I pick up from a lot has a confirmed covid19 caseThey keep him in a negative pressure room and any time the poor fucker is moved from one section of the hospital to another they put him on a ventilator to keep him from spreading that shitThat is what your life is looking like if you catch this and get pneumoniaRestricted to one room and a tube in your throat if you need to leave said room|0

Hi Mr GatesThanks for asking for questions This one is really for Jeff Bezos whom I hope you know  if you could pass along a message that would be amazingPlease tell him  there are a lot of associates at the various fulfillment centers who cant afford to stay home from work unlike my spouse and so are working in crowded conditions Stand up meetings are still shoulder to shoulder associates do not have hand sanitizer equipment is not being sanitized and it is only a matter of time before a lot of people get sick Do we want a COVID epicenter to be an Amazon fulfillment center In addition to the humanitarian crisis this would be a PR disaster of Biblical proportions And centers could get shut down which would be economically devastating for both the associates and their families and communitiesI strongly suggest that  under guidance from public health authorities upper staff should immediately examine hygiene and sanitation at each fulfillment center and establish improvement protocols|0
Whaaaat Community spread In the US No way Im sooo shocked s|0
Other countries are testing waaaayyyyyyyuyu more than the United States Other countries might of dragged their feet before they had any cases but once they got a few cases they started rapidly testing United States has had cases for a few weeks now and still hardly testing people 1 cause they dont have test kits due to wanting to make our own for some reason instead of getting them from somewhere else until we can be self sufficient and 2 because they are sucking at the tit of the financial sector Deny deny deny until its to late at which point the will blame someone else|0

They are hiding community spread in Toronto and I know that for a fact as my cousin is a doctor at Sunnybrook They also arent updating the confirmed cases as fast as they should also today Ontario announced their first priority testing are people who have not travelled with symptoms That not only seems negligent but also you have to ask why that would be their priority httpswwwgooglecaampsbetactvnewscanational202031414853260html|0
They are only recommending stuff which people arent going to listen to This is a pandemic the government needs to enforce shit|0

China released the entire genome for this virus very early and thats when I knew things were bad over there They rarely dont sweep small things under the rug this early cry for help was a pretty obvious indicator that things were going terribly    My real issue is that we the US had two months to watch and learn lessons and instead just sat there pretending like nothing was wrong    People were begging to cut off flights from China we didnt Now China Beijing specifically is cutting off flights from SKIranItaly because they know they should do all they can to stop the spread    And yet we still have a president touting just a flu rhetoric and denying the mortality rate and all saying you can go to work sick just yesterday on Fox|0
Well if its anything like a pregnancy test there is a wide variability as to when a person will get a positive especially if the test isnt sensitive enough to pick it up|1
China took extremely drastic measures to cut spread measures that no western government would be prepared to takeYou should actually listen to what the WHO have said They said that a pandemic can theoretically be avoided but it would be the first time in history that we humans would be successful at doing so Furthermore Im talking about the UK specifically  the WHO are talking about pandemics Im talking about epidemics I take it you know the differenceAgain looking to China for containment methods is a fallacy To give you an example of what I mean it is widely accepted that only the Bolshevist government of Stalin couldve beaten back the Germans during WW2 Why Because they had no respect for human life They had already killed many millions of their own citizens and that was before Operation Barbarossa If Russia was a democracy at the time the government wouldve surrendered after the countless losses inflicted But as it was Stalin was prepared to send his men to the slaughter in their millions and it paid off Likewise China is one of the only countries that could pull off such containment of a virus like this due to their authoritarian methods and disregard for human rightsIm not being lazy or selfish Im being pragmatic The advice the government has sent out to councils is that they expect 100000 deaths with 500000 at the highend thats with 80 of the population infected This was the main article in the Times yesterday If you dont believe that so many people might die why are you so afraid You seem to be contradicting yourself|0

I encourage you to look up photos of isfahan and watch travel videos of iran httpsyoutubeuf2IlgZDxOo It is essentially a 2nd world country But of course since you are a magapede from townsville USA I wouldnt expect you to understand Do you really think america can handle a outbreak like this in boomer populated northern states where SARSCov2 can rapidly spread|1
I mostly agree with you however that was not the point of the report or my comment In the report Their findings demonstrate a strong association between early sustained and layered application of control measures and a reduced mortality Closing schools being one of those measuresGoing full Wuhan right now would allow infection numbers to get low enough to start the traditional contact tracingsmall quarantine strategies traditionally used See South Koreas new infection numbers in the last 2 days for how this can work  Doing anything would be a stark contrast to the reckless course we are on nowEdit very excited to see some actions take tonight Its not comprehensive but its a start|1

Im thinking local community centers clinics hospitals ask someone if you can put up flyers and post on local web forums Also you county aging departments may be in need of volunteers homeless resource centers a lot of volunteers are not showing up for shifts due to fear of spreading but then there is no one to help also disability centersThank you for focusing on equity and trying to be helpful I wish more people were focusing on how to help others instead of doomsday prepping for themselves|1
 thats right They already have tons of the appropriate ppe and personal trained to doff it with out contaminating themselves They might actually be better prepared than a lot of other countries|1

I think you messed up the math actually the first figure is for total deaths in the whole population the second is for deaths from those infectedSince the flu does not infect everybody your first figure is too low The usual figure for flu CFR is around 005 to 01 depending on the country|0
Now overlay deaths Its important for people to understand the IMPACT of that spike on outcomes|1

What a joke|1
As someone with family and friends who lived in the Soviet Union and live in communist China I would be wary about jumping on that bandwagon Entrenched corrupt elites that dont serve the interests of the common people is a flaw with both our system and those systems and apparently a lot of Europe considering recent developments with the disease coverups surrounding it and other larger issues There needs to be a definite correcting and change to the status quo but capitalism and socialism are both very flawed and we need to work on developing something elseYang had some great ideas with the basic income idea and some of his other ideas  but we need more technocratic thinking like thatBasic income isnt really a purely socialist idea either as the capitalist Milton Freidman also advocated it|1

Roughly 4 in 5 chance of mild symptoms 1 in 5 chance of severe I dont like those odds even if Im more likely to fall in the mild group|0

If it was just about stemming panic it seems hospitals would be prepared and labs already in place given there was 3 months notice to prepare They dont have enough protective gear either I definitely think some of it was about curbing panic but it had to be widely spread before they seemingly did anything to act on it|0

dude its like people remember that back in the day you had to hoard because shit was sparse but they kinda forgot what to hoard and also that we live in absolute abundance right now Instead they choose to ignore the prime ministers plead about not hoarding and staying home keep gatherings small and instead goes into overcrowded supermarkets and stand in line for hours It would not surprise me one bit if we receive information that one of the fools is tested positive for corona virus and everyone that went and stood there for hours now has to be quarantined|0

I have a coworker at the hospital right now with a super high fever refusing testing and we have two guys from another office with tests pending after confirmed contact  Were in an area thats ground zero for our state We arent in a job that can telework There isnt any kind of contingency for this Weve been told to just go home if we dont feel comfortable and today they sent home the guy who worked with fever guy yesterday Ive been working with fever guy for the past two weeks My SO works at an old folks home and Im worried about passing it to her then her passing it on to them I dont want to be the catalyst for another Seattle situationIm really not sure what to do but things are getting real real fast|0
I dont know about you but this is the one and only time Im willing to suffer some abdication of my human rights if it means itll keep the entirety of the country from becoming infectedIf they told you to report to the authorities about what is obviously a contagious disease and you ignored it then that makes you a jerk|0

Some of us will lose everything Most americans live paycheck to paycheck Id rather live somewhere that doesnt operate this way but the way things are right now tons of people are probably carrying it have a suspicion that they are carrying it but have to work because they have a mortgage and additional bills and without tests if you just take off on a suspicion you might be screwed ifwhen we come back from this with some form of alleviation for people Hell im not even confident that this will happen|0
As terrible as this is I think a pandemic in any country is going to result in similar conditions No matter how wellequipped a facility is there is a limited amount of space staff supplies and outside resources Eventually they will all degenerate into this sort of scenario That is why preventing the spread through strict triage and quarantine is vital|0
No reason to feel empathy for those who combine hatefulness with ignorance and stupidity Better off without those types in the world|0

Ya its not like doctors arent entirely aware of the risks of CT scans They really try not to do them if theyre not entirely necessary especially in young people|0
Hell even if they told the absolute truth haha theyd still have missed a shit ton of cases due to an overwhelmed health system that had to focus on the more severe casesIt also ignores the level of quarantine put in place Id say its safe to assume that China saw far more infections than they could possibly test for many of which will have been resolved in quarantine without medical attention We can also assume that it would have been far far worse if they hadnt used their authoritarian system to quarantine entire cities|0
You end the transmission chains locking down until nobody is infectious any more It takes 46 weeks then you remain vigilant after the lockdown ends like china is doing less than two months after the quarantines began  The UKs plan sounds great perhaps but hiding everyone over 65 from the world for 46 months is impossible Secondly if the death rate under the age of 65 was even 01 thats still 50000 dead people over 6 months  So honestly its a pretty disastrous fucking plan|0
Its a typo because Im dumb|0
We havent closed travel from anywhere Only travellers from Hubei and Iran must call local health dept 24h from arrival and self quarantine for 14 days Considering Ontario hospitals already practise hallway healthcare during normal demand for beds we are completely letting our elderly down with our inaction|0

I am being analytical   I am not absolving anyone of blame but I am putting together a puzzle and formulating an opinion based up evidence and accusation to reach a conclusion  YOu can disagree with it if you like but please refrain from accusing me of doing some that I am notIf you research my post history I have been more than complimentary as to how China reacted to this situation over people calling them out for it as I realized the ends justified the means   You are looking for something that is not thereThat is to say I can be of the opinion that Chinas inaction caused the situation in Wuhan to spiral out of control necessitating their overreaction to contain it And thank GOD they did thatI can also say the majority of the rest of the world has done the same thing only China at least was caught off guard  These two things are not the same I am looking at each independentlyYou are thinking I am saying this is all Chinas fault   Not the case|1
I hope hes your ex husband now|1
Everyone should be aware of this A single CT scan exposes a patient to the equivalent of about 200 chest xrays I had a friend go through this and she was grateful to get the body scan to diagnose her condition When we found out how much radiation it exposes a person we couldnt believe that the doctor the technicians and the hospital have her proper warning before hand|1

LOL you really think its TrumpStop and think for just a moment  there have been soooo many damaging leaks of information from inside the government since he took office Do you really think IF the lack of testing was his doing we wouldnt be hearing from 1000 different sources Trump is not allowing us to test Its not him its the SYSTEM They cannot test and will not test until one of two things happens  1 Its pretty much an epidemic everywhere else or2   They have an outbreak and either too many dead bodies or too many sick doctors to cover upWhy Because the US Dollar is the flight to safety if we have an epidemic early that will no longer be the case MoneyEconomy over Truth Simple as that|0

I hope that NYT and other news sites follow suitPaywalls for vital information for things like politics and disasters and especially for things like this are absurd The people who are more likely to not get tested people who cant afford to miss work or dont have the insurance to pay for testing and treatment certainly arent gonna have the money to spend on a news website|1
We have created an economy where the tiniest bit of bad news can wipe millions of a countrys stock exchange No one can be seen to be proactive because that would be seen as alarmist and spook the markets And in general being proactive costs money No one wants to be that person who makes a fuss about nothing and costs everyone a lot of money Its not an attempt to deliberately kill off vulnerable people its that the economy is more important to those in charge than saving a few lives Gotta keep that lobbyist money coming in|0

well 100 million a day theyve been quarantined for about 30 days so thats 3 billion masks subtract 10 for medical people thats 27 billion masks assuming schools remain close until June like the gov plans to do then thats 30 of the demographics staying home remove 11 of the population 65 and older and you have about 60 of people who need to work currently the country does a shift system where 13 of the workforces show up each day and this measure will continue until further notice so thats 20 of population working outside each day 27 billion masks lets assume each mask lasts 2 days on average N95 respirators can be worn for multiple days surgical masks for 1 day that gives you 54 billion day uses20 of the population working outside is a burn rate of 300 million uses a day which at the above calculated level will last 18 days in 18 days it will also produce 18 billion masks representing 36 billion day uses which provides protection for an additional 12 days which generates 12 billion additional masks providing 24 billion day uses thats another additional 8 days which generates 800 million masks or 16 billion day uses etc this above backofenvelop calc means china can stay protected for maybe 4045 days by then itll be approaching June and then we will see what happens faced with either further spreading the virus or diverting manufacturing resources to mask making i think the gov will choose mask making which will increase capacity further to further stretch this out|1
We are still at the beginning of this pandemic it is highly contagious and is going to get much more widespread Majority will be fine Bear in mind 1 million people is like 000015 of the world population It seems like a lot but for a global pandemic its a pretty small number I think given the current trajectory and fatality rate millions is a fairly safe bet but spread around the world and concentrated on elderly and those with compromised immune systems and other significant risk factors|1

Fun fact the name Spanish Flu isnt because the flu originated in Spain  The 1918 flu H1N1 got that nickname because every government except Spain actively suppressed news about the virus  Sound familiar  Troops were likely infected in Kansas then were deployed many of them ill to the front lines  Doctors pleading for delays in deployments were ignored due to war efforts and it spread all the more  When Spain reported freely about the epidemic it was assumed thats where it came from Source Extra Credit The 1918 Flu PandemichttpsyoutubeXQ9WX4qVxEo|0

Im not saying that it isnt terrible everyones life matters That wasnt the point I was makingIm saying that it isnt the black plague simply because it is killing the elderly that are likely making up the vast majority of current severe cases to begin withYou cannot then assume that it will affect the majority in the same way it is currently affecting the 20 or that it is nearly as deadly as you are insinuating It may be but there isnt enough concrete information to draw any conclusionsI do agree that there are a lot of crazy douche bags out there who dont care about the elderly dying to this or any illness Ive even read comments on Youtube about how its good economically for the rest of us and less social security being paid out But Im not one of those people who think like thatSo dont try and put words in my mouth jutsu Unless youre just venting in general But your venting comes from my post which is concerning Hopefully Ive clarified on whatever was lost in translation|0
Hes done a stellar job at essentially forcing experts to leave the government and leaving many critical agencies with party hacks or donors in charge as acting heads I do not trust any of the people he has chosen to lead the federal government to manage this crisis effectively at this point in time we are long past the point where he should have appointed a well qualified individual to coordinate our response and unify the efforts of the various departments who handle this sort of crisis Obama put Ron Klain in charge of the Ebola response and we ended up with something like 2 cases stateside while that outbreak was occurring Granted that was an easier crisis to navigate but the Trump administration has shown nothing but either apathy or ignorance of the crisis unfolding upon the world Empty tweets that lie about how well this is being handled are not going to solve anything Its a disaster in the making|0

It matters because theres asymptomatic spread as well so anyone that may have come into contact with the infected person needs to be tracked down and testedbecause then those people mightve infected more people as well One person infects 2 or more people Then those people infect 2 or more people And they infect 2 or more and so on and so forth The growth is exponential from there on out If they cant contain the spread through contact tracing and tests then the cases will continue to spread exponentially to the point where the hospital system becomes completely overwhelmed As we already know 20 of cases are severe enough to need hospitalization but if the hospitals get maxed out the 13 CFR could easily shoot up to toward that 20 rate Think of how many preventable deaths will occur just because they couldnt receive adequate care|0

DiscussionQuickly identifying persons at risk for 2019nCoV is critical to slowing the potential spread of 2019nCoV in the United States This report describes CDCs current approach to facilitating recommended diagnostic testing of persons who might have 2019nCoV infection In response to the emergence of 2019nCoV in China during a time of rapidly evolving understanding of the epidemiology and clinical presentation of 2019nCoV infection CDC has provided consultation regarding persons suspected of being at risk for 2019nCoV to public health officials and health care providers throughout the United StatesEpidemiologic risk factors among the 210 persons tested for 2019nCoV were not limited to travel 20 of PUIs tested had not recently traveled to China but reported close contact with a person being evaluated for 2019nCoV infection Because persontoperson transmission is expected to continue and as further travel restrictions are implemented it is likely that the proportion of PUIs with such contact risk in the United States will increase among all persons evaluated for 2019nCoVCDC mobilized early in the response and state and local health departments similarly increased capacity to provide clinical consultation regarding 2019nCoV The collection of clinical and epidemiologic data that described characteristics of persons tested for 2019nCoV helped to inform changes to criteria for PUI evaluationOn January 31 2020 CDC published updated PUI guidance 8 in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019nCoV including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of persontoperson transmission 9 Updated guidance emphasizes 2019nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019nCoV infection persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019nCoV epidemiology continues to improveThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations First the number of clinical inquiries received by CDC does not represent all inquiries received by health departments Second because the primary objective of this effort was to guide a timely public health response some clinical and epidemiologic risk factor data might be incomplete Finally given the limited available epidemiologic information early in the outbreak to provide some latitude for clinical decisionmaking regarding diagnostic testing the PUI definition was not strictly applied in all casesA coordinated national effort to diagnose 2019nCoV among persons at high risk for infection is important to facilitate appropriate management and limit transmission in the United States CDCs website provides guidance for health care professionals on evaluating persons for 2019nCoV 10 Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for possible 2019nCoV illness not only among persons with fever and lower respiratory tract illness who report travel from China in the past 14 days but also symptomatic persons who have had close contact with patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019nCoV infection Clinicians should consult their local and state health departments when they suspect possible 2019nCoV illness to facilitate diagnosis and aid prevention efforts|0
It seems theres not a ton of uniformity between data being reported  like no baseline criteria aside from a Positive test result seems to be the same across the board so I think this may lead to a range of different conclusions being drawn I think the reality is its too early to draw most of the conclusions people seem to be drawing|1

It has killed 2362 as of today  The flu is worse only in that it has become endemic in the population and therefore has infected and killed a lot more people But cv is  more contagious and much more lethal than influenza and will in all probability become endemic as well   So while one can say the flu is worse by the numbers that is only a temporary situation|0

It was difficult The people I let go were really good people One was a single dad who just started with our company just a few months ago The company he previously worked for went under and he was laid off there as well So this is like a double whammy in a 6 month period for him I just had a conversation with my superior the previous week about promoting him And here I am today saying I have to let you go The other guy I had to let go I had a huge heart for He iswas my hardest worker The guy was flexible hard working didnt complain and overall had a great attitude I would duplicate him and hire 10 of him if I could It makes me sad for them all Its heart breaking|1

The media is really annoying me on this Back when there were only 2000 cases in China they were running scare stories about how the KILLER DEADLY VIRUS was on the brink of becoming a pandemic now that thats far more likely to actually happen a lot of outlets seem to have lost interest I guess a theoretical fear sells papers or clicks or whatever but fear of something that might really kill you just puts customers off|0

 They already did that and it worked well A subsequent study on hydroxychloroquine show that it works even better But results in a test tube are not the same thing as results in a live animal let alone in a human  Lots of stuff that works well in the lab is a bust when you put it in a real person And in fact this wouldnt be the first time chloroquine showed promise for  A major disease in the lab only to fail in practice  Also studies are being run in China South Korea Australia all over the world Dont worry the word is going to get out one way or the other|1

Honestly im not getting it people have been infected more than once lets put aside the whole moral issue literally letting people die how is that even going to work I dont know much about infections but recurring viruses arent thatrare I think i got the flu more than 4 times in one year being infected once didnt made me immune I would like to understand UKs point of view here how is it going to work exactly Is there any science behind this statement or its just a lazy attempt at giving people a solution|0
From what ive read online small towns have their own special susceptibilities especially remote ones such as lack of these services I wouldnt necessarily let your guard down just because your in a small town It would only take one person for it to possibly start spreading Even small towns have their own hubs where people gather and if it becomes widespread it can very quickly overwhelm your local medical system especially given they are often given less priority then the bigger hospitals because of the lack of population|0
He didnt short sell Novartis He bought them and a half dozen other pharmacutical companies and elimanted their RD departments because they cost too much A pharmacutical company without RD has a shelf life Yet through fraud he kept it propped up for a lot longer But he decimated RD in Canada and US Which we could really use right now|0

That depends on location We need to have very strict quarantine in areas with more known cases And test nonstop to know where they are before symptoms are popping up everywhere People focus on the number of beds in our country but it will always be local areas that are overwhelmed not some national pervasiveness of the disease|1

He did not infect his dog THAT is the point They were able to find SarsCoV2 on a dogs nose which does not mean the dog was infected with COVID19 it means that there were germs transmitted onto the dog which is something differentYou can transmit a virus onto your mobile but this doesnt mean your mobile is infected If an infected person touches things he can transmit germs onto them That still doesnt make them actually infected and spread infections themselves There are zero confirmed cases of dogs or cats with actual infections|0

Yep Trudeau said the American actions were unreasonable and that any precautions even buying masks was racist and sinophobic He also used this narrative to quickly quell any dissent or questions within the House Our government is incompetent and corrupt so they sucked up to China as much as possible during the opening days They also pretended we were so enlightened for doing nothing because the US was doing something efficacy aside they at least did something|0

Its not true to say the only option atm would be to isolate everyone counties like SK have made changes across the whole county isolation is not the only option  Getting surgical masks for everyone and making it a crime to go out without wearing one should be the minimum they do  As it is they are lying and saying masks dont stop spread this is a lie they offer little protection to the individual however if everyone wears they are effective as they stop asymptomatic of selfish symptomatic people spreading it onto surfaces and people|0

Also the title of this post is very misleading The 2nd article link that was posted in the comments saysChinese scientists found that the coronavirus causing COVID19 has two mutations Scov and a more dangerous Lcov that features higher transmissibility and inflicts more harm to the human respiratory systemthe Lcov was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan but declined in early JanuaryBasically it did mutate to be more aggressive but that more aggressive strain became less common in early January likely because people were more quickly identified as being sick and therefore isolated and the virus could not be transmitted on to as many people|0

Bill I read the Imperial College COVID19 Response TeamhttpswwwimperialacukmediaimperialcollegemedicinesphidegidafellowshipsImperialCollegeCOVID19NPImodelling16032020pdf report as well as this explanation in a historical contexthttpstwittercomjeremycyoungstatus1239975682643357696 Essentially it says that by doing nothing 4 million Americans die Through the mitigation strategy  ie social distancing and flattening the curve  it says that 112 million Americans will die However it also says that the suppression strategy or shutting everything down for 18 months  will lead to only a few thousand people dying Do you agree with these numbers and if so is there any excuse for not immediately issuing a shelter in place order for the entire country|1

Aight I did some reading on this heres what I take away from the pdfx200BThis whole thing is based on the Idea that SARSCoV can spread through synapses  connected to the cardiorespiratory center from  the mechano and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory  airways and suggests the notion that this MAY play A ROLE in the acute respiratory failure For a starter thats an awfull lot of ifs and maybes yet this shouldnt be disregarded and certainly AS THE TEXT SAYS be inquired upon further This thing is literally a Hey okay so this might be a thing for some were unsure if it really is and if so to what extend it really is but someone should maybe look into it in the future This is valid speculation over a concern Is it truly a final fact like the misleading title suggests No Its a speculative concern People before you post this shit to panic everyone out Read it and at least understand how and why this was written|0
 Well its a very very important question and thats where a lot of the debate has been and one of the theories is that perhaps you could take it on the chin take it all in one go and allow the disease as it were to move through the population without taking as many draconian measures My point is that if he is saying that someone in his advisory team has proposed exactly that I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might beHe also said this and yet it seems increasingly clear by comparing the governments actions to those of other countries that this is not what he is doing|1
Add Iran who reports doubtful numbers of recovered patients while South Korea barely has any since theyre actually taking this seriously|0
Reading this leaves me with so many questionsChina kept talking about a small percentage of patients that recovered getting reinfected does this indicate they might have contracted the different strainAlso why does the WHO keep specifying the Italian strain the Wuhan strain and the Iranian strain Do they know the virus is mutating that fast or just using those labels to differentiate the regions|0

Thats a terrible thing to say Those passengers didnt ask for this They didnt ask to be confined to tiny rooms on a floating Petri dish They didnt ask for WHO to totally screw this up What needs to happen is each country needs to fly their citizens home similar to how the US did and then quarantine them an additional 14 days before letting them go back to their homes But in reality this virus has already gotten out its just a matter of time until it starts popping up everywhere|0
Cant rule that out eitherI try to give them more credit|1

This one study keeps reering its head on this sub It was an animal study I believe Even stated that theres no reason to believe that it would affect humans in the same way But it doesnt matter now unless SARS were to somehow come backThere are scores of vaccines already entering animal testing around the world Until we see some results its just total speculation|0

Add to that theres no heating in the south which is where Wuhan is so theyre all indoors at about 1214 degrees Probably a bit warmer now than a week or more back but still not even up to 18 degree comfort levels in most areas south of Shenzhen etc  this does not help recovering or avoiding catching a virus|0

Flu kills like 50k80k Americans every year Even with vaccination|0
stupid as fuck in China all the stores and markets dont let u enter without a mask and temperature checks literally everywhere|0
Washington and the local city officials really dropped the ball agreed The good news is its a lot less harmful than we thought Also the US has handled it better than most countries Those developing countries with severely low numbers are a huge red flagLets be real a handful of cases only reported in the developing world with almost no testing being done|1
Once the outbreak is over the two are identical All known cases either die or recover|0
Oh wow I didnt know you can lose a Reddit account like that But good for you As someone who have been through SARS in pretty much the epicenter I stocked up on masks also pretty early on this time Its certainly very hard to set the perspective for people if they havent been through similar situation before|1
Im with you on this There seems to be a significant misinterpretation of what Boris and the advisors said Which is worrying Are people with cold like symptoms self isolating like they should be If people cant understand social distancing will be introduced as needed can they understand self isolate for 7 days if you have cold like symptomsThe sad irony is we will end up with an Italian style lockdown as people are to thick to understand simple English|1
Yea statistics needs to be a mandatory class to graduate high school  Ive heard from about a dozen different people well the flu kills more people  You talk about the mortality RATE and their eyes glaze over  When this is all over a lot of people will have blood on their hands  Such as town mayors who refuse to close schools|0
No one knows your dumb code letters|0
Thats good It sounds like they are at least trying to take precautions|1
Well we can have new ones and hire those who doesnt even have a job and have a college degree only hanging on their walls|1
Yea Im very worried Im a sophomore in high school and I come back from spring break next week and Im trying my best not to get it I am in San Antonio and colleges and school districts are closing around me but my district still refuses to close My grandma has been fighting cancer for years now and its spread into her hip She is very weak with the chemo and if I accidentally spread COVID19 to her its over I cant skip school cause truancy laws so I just have to try my best until the school administration gets their heads out of the ground and sees the powder keg awaiting before them|0
at work today someone tells out the flu kills more people its just the flu what can we do to protect ourselves except wash out handsthen proceeds to spit on the ground|0
Sorry to hear that I had a similar experience It started with conjunctivitis after my son got it it spread to my wife and I so I was not paying attention when some low fever started But the low fever went on and on my eyes got well and then the headaches started just like you described It was hurting so much that I couldnt stand daylight I went to a health center they gave me an MRI came back normal RX normal and blood tests because of the monolike symptoms When the viral tests came back they were positive for EBV parvovirus cytomegalovirus and some hepatitis viruses too So they said it wasnt possible that all were positive and that they had to retest Long story short they just gave me ibuprofen paracetamol and some stronger NSAIDs which turned headaches to tolerable I got better by rest at home In the meantime I got bronchitis which also passed with a month of restFelt abandoned by modern medicine I tested again and six weeks later I got the results from a different lab Again all viruses positive By that time I was feeling still under the weather and would tire just from walking a block Couple of months passed I gradually recovered and carried on It took its due time to finally get on the path of recovery After endless visits I even had one physician tell me that a month of mild fever was not a signal of anything I felt that I had to take care of myself with help from my family because the healthcare system didnt have a place for unusual cases like mineHope you fully recover|1
No this is just wrong The reason why youre seeing a decreasing rate is because the model is percentage based Assuming that Chinas limited by the availablity of test kits then adding a constant amount of cases per day will obviously make the relative increase of total cases smaller  And we can see that China is indeed limited by its test kits If you model it linearly then it can be seen that increase in cases per day is a constant 2000 Its likely that once today is finished the number of cases will be about 16000Edit My argument doesnt hold up as well for the first 2 days as the daily increases there seem to be less than 2000 This might be because earlier China had lower testing capabilities|0
So in the rest of US is being done only 6000 tests in total That is ridiculous Thats pretty scary I am from slovakia we have done something over 1000 tests yet and we are country of 5 million and people are concern about this not being enough yet the whole country is being closed down DPRK style since today I wonder what NY is going to look like That is going to be a disaster If northern italy cant coop with this disease or spain It is going to be very challenging in US with your healthcare system and also your freedom I dont want to spread panic but so far it looks like you are going to take it in iranian manners|1
Glad you are feeling a bit better hope youre all well soon Isnt the Vicks the weirdest thing|1
Ive never used nitrile gloves more than once But there is no reason they cannot be re used if they were intact and properly decontaminated thats a 30 minute soak  in a 10 bleach solution They float so make sure you weight them down Or spend the 20 bucks and get a set of 100 and throw them out each time I use the venom steel brand from Lowes They are black and thick They have a second inner layer that shows any tears in white I use them once and trash them|1
My SO has been out of a job since last Friday He was working 2 parttime jobs None are compensating him for the indefinite work One of his employers are a small mompop shop that was barely making it So he will just have to file for unemployment for the time being and hope when everything is over hell still have his 2 jobsMy brotherinlaw works at a gym he just found out hes out of a job for a minimum of 30days starting today at 8pm His wife is a bartender and also found out shes out of a job for the same amount of time Neither are getting any compensation from their jobMy brother works at a nonessential store in the Bay Area and so he just lost his income for 2 monthsIts been terrifying|0
I think that the majority of people knows that the masks arent 100 effective but they know also that they do offer protection But again its better if they are used by sick people doctors nurses immunocompromised and elderly people|0
 assuming its too late to do anything except get sick recover get past it cut your elderly lossesSo how come China arent following this Theyve gone to extreme measures and the whole world can see it  Also the UK at least already have quite extreme measures prepared eg httpsnewsskycomstorymillionsofpeoplecouldbetoldtoselfisolateinukreport11935377|0
Yes|1
So the problem is that theres insufficient masksThen why your disingenuous claim that masks dont prevent people from falling sick Just come clean and says that theres insufficient masks and whatever supply is available needs to be prioritized|0
It is easy to underestimate the number of infection cases when no testing is doneHey Canada  now you can clue in and follow the USA who finally is taking action  thanks to Trump and Pence albeit they did this very late but still|1

Why should they stay openFor people whose jobs are relatively safe to do during this crisisDo people desperately need a new outfitNo That could be an example of a business that should be closed or restrictedA shiny new electronic deviceId argue that if your mobile phone or computer breaks it could be vital to get a new oneDoes office based work HAVE to be done in an officeIf it can be done from home it should be done from homeDo kids NEED that hot new toyNoTrust me Id be impacted hard by a general shut down but why should it stay openIm not saying that all businesses should stay open I think many should close for a few monthsStaying open forcing workers to come in to do next to no work because no one is using the service costing the company extra in running costs just on the CHANCE someone might shop with you is more damaging financially than closingIm not disputing thatBusinesses should be shutting up shop where possibleNo They should be shutting where suitable not possiblepeople should be ordering their groceries online where possible DistanceisessentialAgreed|0
The government has been crippled by design I dont trust them doing anything but make it worse until a new administration has been voted in|0

Are they afraid the WHO will see why the mortality rate for the infected seems to be so in excess of the rest of the world |0
Tbh if what Ive read is true you probably wont need to go to the hospital I know everyone here will hate this but this comes from a coworkers parents whove had it in China its just a bit worse then the normal flu So take that with a grain of salt but I think youll be fine And if your not Then get mad at some dude on Reddit I guess lol|1
This looks like something the US would do|1
Like Im sure hes needed but if you only have to deal with 3 bodies on a cruise and that probably takes maybe 34 hours each hes getting paid to just chill for the vast majority of his shift How do you get this job|1
I feel awful for Italy this kind of damage done is insane|0
And what hospital are you going to visit for your appendectomy if its filled with old people Or should we just be fine with our medical system collapsing and reverting back to the middleages Thats the bigger picture here|0
When I asked for advice I just meant the actual situation of being in a quarantine not how to avoid getting the virus It can be psychologically straining to sit in a house all day with absolutely nothing to do Thank you though|0

Yeah they did Their productivity is SCARY Not to forget the fact they built several makeshift hospitals in 45 days at the heat of the outbreak they turned a bunch of their factories around to producing medical equipment such as this I believe they were up to 2 million facemasks pr day a couple of weeks ago|0
This is disgusting from the CDC What the actual fuck This poor nurse doing her fucking job getting shafted now because of an incompetent administration If I survive this I am moving to South Korea|0

Ill tell you what I tell everyone Avoid any form of public transportion Airplanes are especially bad cause everyone is in there for a comparativly long time and you cant crack a window so the potentielly infetious air is just blown in your face by the airconditioningEven if you are not in a group with a high risk of death if you care about the people around you who are in a high risk group dont travel right now|0

Ive been forced to work sick with a fever several times due to bare minimum staffing Put a mask on I can only hope this attitude in healthcare will change Speaking from experience few attorneys are interested in this sort of thing Suing also creates a likelihood of being blacklisted at least where I liveWe will actually be written up and fired for calling out for legitimate illness so I totally understand OPs situation Granted Im in a right to work state so its barbaric hereAs much as you are correct about the need for OP to stay away from patients hospitals have been known to talk out of both sides of their mouths and OP is at the mercy of their employers staffing ratios|0
A surprise to no one Well maybe not no one|0
Ask yourself that again if were still down six months from now Flattening the curve is achievable and worth temporary shutdowns But society cannot survive this state indefinitely  If this drags on as we wait for a vaccine that remains several months away the consensus will shift to letting it burn to be done with it|1

Places like John Hopkins are releasing daily situation reportshttpwwwcenterforhealthsecurityorgresourcesCOVID19indexhtmlThis is from the CDC website The potential public health threat posed by COVID19 is high both globally and to the United States The fact that this disease has caused illness including illness resulting in death and sustained persontoperson spread in China is concerning These factors meet two of the criteria of a pandemic Its unclear how the situation will unfold but risk is dependent on exposureI think it is AS CLEAR AS THEY CAN MAKE IT without scaring people|1

 Thinking and responding in the same wave length  Focused and locked and loaded mentally  I keep trying to act like everything is ok for everyone elses sake but underneath Im losing my shit Seriously thinking like a soldier  But Im female  I just know the naked reality but I dont want to alarm anyone  Its almost like I am telling myself to be quiet  prepare and dont make others hysterical pby uttering whats really happening  But then I catch myself thinking  God am I really doing them a favor or just giving myself more time to get my family stuff squared away   in peace  Who knows really In a month what itll be like I feel like I cant second guess myself now  Ive come to a conclusion based on the evidence from reddit franklyIm not even watching news  I know those videos happening in real time with no commercial interest or visible gain to be hadIs the only news I can trust anymore is from shaking phones in China  I think so  Its a voice that keeps saying keep the faith and help others Stuff is going to get real interesting I can hear all the old soldiers saying in my head  And Im just standing on the corner looking at this upcoming shit storm doing a low key off key whistle fade to black|1
That would be the true story and why  The governors should be asking the Fed to implement price control  I have not heard any blocking from the CDC and not sure how the CDC has any power to block anyone but there are some guidelines to report cases from our state and gain assistance from Fed that if does not fit into CDC guideline that can block assistance|0
My point is that a democracy an do all of the reasonable policies implemented in Wuhan as I discussed without the authoritarian baggage of perfect control that very effectively prevented people from saving their own lives See my long paragraph of why government control was counterproductive in Wuhan in many instances|1
As an American its really reassuring that other countries are going through such political unrest Not because I want to see other countries fail but because for years now Ive only been thinking about how America is the absolute scum of the developed world and how other nations are literally 20 years ahead of us politically speaking  how perfect everyone else is because they have free healthcare and educationI dont say this to say that Australia  Britain are on the USs level politically they are still light years beyond but I have created some sort of fantasized picture in my head about how if I moved to another country everything would be this happy carefree place with rainbows  sunshine  everyones a billionaire It has taken some eye opening to realize that other nations still have problems to get through and none of them are perfect yetE grammar|1

Going outdoors isnt bad in this situation its actually good When they say dont go out they mean to places with people not dont go outside As long as you stay away from other people youre good Even walking past your neighbours windows should be fine as long as they arent standing right there coughing on you and the chances of your dog bringing in viruses on the bottom of his paws and you picking it up from your apartment floor are really really tiny Walk him at odd times of day when no one else is around if possible Good luck and stay strong|1

I was thinking that too  My fiance and her friend who is a nurse seem to have their heads in the sand  To be fair were 30s and healthy getting sick isnt likely to be that bad for us   But the impact that worries me is about global supply healthcare overload recession and mass deaths among the elderlySo what Ive been thinking is how many US cases or how many US deaths is it going to take before they take this seriously  Then maybe I could venture a guess in days or weeks when wed reach that|0

 No new countries reported cases of COVID19 in the past 24 hours WHO is working with an international network of statisticians and mathematical modelers to estimate key epidemiologic parameters of COVID19 such as the incubation period the time between infection and symptom onset case fatality ratio CFR the proportion of cases that die and the serial interval the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case Reports of current analyses that have estimated these parameters are provided in this Situation Report as a summary of currently available evidence These values should be considered preliminary and parameters will likely be updated as more information becomes available Modelling can support decisionmaking but needs to be combined with rigorous data collection and a comprehensive analysis of the situation Please see the Subject in Focus section for more information Several online courses related to COVID19 have been added to the OpenWHO platformo A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses including novel coronaviruses available in French Simplified Chinese and Spanish as wello Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infectionso Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases  ePROTECT|1
I think that air quality in China contributes to lower immunity is good hypothesis to make But judging from SK and Italy this is a very contagious virus And long encubation and many mild cases make it very hard to detect Regardless we can speculate all we want but right now the best thing you can do is protect yourself please Reduce congregate with others avoid crowded and especially indoor places like buses and mallsKeep good distance with others 15 m and aboveKeep good air circulation in indoor airsAvoid touching face area with your handWash and disinfect your hands with alcohol 75 isopropyl alcohol can kill the virusDisinfect surfaces regularlyAvoid going to restaurants because of the crowd and dishes are shared The virus can live on a surface for sometime and you are not sure how they disinfect the dishes Order take out is better Or cook at home is the bestStock up on food masks disinfecting products|1

While I despise the Islamic Republic of Iran I am beginning to question the conspiratorial mindset Whats increasingly clear is that the coronavirus is extremely contagious seems like superspreaders are common With that in mind its easy for one person to be undetected and for a cluster to emerge out of nowhereFor all that we know someone from China didnt directly bring the virus to Iran May have been someone traveling from Thailand or Singapore or India etc|1

I think youre right But timing is everything Were freaking out about hundreds numbers now Thats a drop in the ocean Pretty soon we will hear the word millions floated We need to stage our response and enact the most draconian measures as the impact begins to peakPulling the ripcord too early will mean reduced Impact and higher chance of pushback from society The people who are advising this have access to the best statistical models I strongly believe we should listen to them|1
Raises a huge question for me What are the current US protocols Tbh I am wondering if we even have any in place right now I get the sense we are ignoring China because we consider them somehow beneath us But we are following Korea Is that the protocol that is in place Is there a place where the CDC is setting guideline or does this very hospital to hospital It all feels really as hoc in the state compared to what I hear about elsewhere|0

The entire point of that system is it reduces the likelihood of overwhelmed systems Every person has the basic necessities on hand to reduce the strain in disasters Every city has its plans and reserves for when a disaster is to much for a community to handle every state has a plan for when a city is hit with something it cant handle and the federal government has aid for when a state cant handle Cities aid other cities states aid other states and nations aid other nationsCommunities that dont expect to do the majority of the work to save there own community are black triage when everyone is overwhelmed You can unfuck one city that never saw fit to have disaster plans or you can send aid to a hundred that only need a little to stay on top of the situation|0

Im merely a layman on this topic but Ill answer it to the best of my understandingYou can look up the wavelength of the specific UV light its a broad spectrum and see if this would help I would be careful using this in an enclosed room because this process emits albeit a very small ozone gas that is very noticeable Generally these UVGI systems use UVC which are usually lower intensity and higher wavelength than standard UV light This cuts down on ozone creation during the process overall in exchange for requiring slightly longer exposure times to be effective|1

My hypothesis is we are at about 7x the cases of South Korea Heres my logic US and S Korea had first cases within a day or so in January While they tested a lot and took action to prevent the spreading we did not They have denser populations but took care So if the details are a wash just multiple their numbers to overlay to our population size in US 50M vs 340M so we have 7x the people we should be 7x of the cases at leastThey report 8000 cases as of 314 so does it make sense we should be at 54000 cases now  if we were actually testing  I fear our US numbers are far worse|0

Yeah history wont look on this bunch of idiots too kindly if we look back in years time at such a terrible pandemic and all our government done was tell us to wash our hands I truly believe they are happy to let this run its course as quick as possible along with all the deaths because people lives are secondary to the economy This nonsense about the science the evidence the models etc etc is just that Nonsense Dear plebs you could never hope to understand the complex information we are using because we are making it as complex as possible to give us something to hide behind An excuse to wash our hands of responsibility Well when it is the governments nearest and dearest dying or even some of them I hope they will finally see the error of their ways|1

This is not the entire story My gf is from is from Wuhan and have pets she told me that when a person got infected or isolated theres firstly organizations that can keep the pets for the owner Ms Chen is probably one of those but shes an individual Secondly you have the option to send your pets to relatives or friends then you can actually bring your pet to the isolation room if youre not confirmed so no hospital for you Then finally if the pet have nowhere to gosome extreme cases they might take it or leave it some food to live with or kill it out of kindnessleave it alone|0

Wuhan at the epicentre has 11 million people and only 80000 cases in total So currently less than 1 of their population has been affected and my understanding is the rate of new infections is dropping so its already fizzing outWe will probably see similar spread in other countries where about 1 of the population is exposed and 24 of them mostly elderly will die Theres currently worldwide 111746 cases and 3888 deaths|0

But that also ties to the same problem in a different wayIf youre not welloff would you rather see a store has lots left at 1099 relatively high but possible if youre not well off or have it be advertised on the shelves for 299 but a scalper got there first and is outside the door saying 500 bucks for one thing of it Oh you dont have 500 bucks Give me your car You dont have a car 15 minutes with your wife or daughter Then you have far worse problems for the people who arent well off at least 1099 is more of a hardship but the hardship becomes okay I have to quit smoking for a week or so instead of Its impossible|0

Combination of all Id wager1 Population with highsmoker concentration and exposure to very poor quality air2 Extremely high population density3 Quarantine coupled with lack of information from government has led to a general panic with a lot of people going to the hospital with mild symptoms its still coldflu season after all where they get exposed to nCoV from infected patients|0

Yeah I think the actual number of infected is much higher but many dont have symptoms or just have VERY mild symptoms and so dont seek medical attention though However that still leaves the question if its so mild in so many people then how come Wuhan is having massive hospital overcrowding Does the virus just spread incredibly fast and so lots of people with weakened immune systems all flood the hospitals at once Do people in Wuhan go to the hospital if they get the sniffles Plain old panic Are people in Wuhan more susceptible to the virus than others for some reason like more people smoke Or some other medical reason combination of all just creating a perfect storm |1

I understand where youre coming from The government again needs to kick it in gear and get support out there whether monetary or other Create free testing this isnt about a quick buck now its about stamping this shit out we can deal with consequences later after we get as many through this thing as possible|1
We have a year to see how this plays out To put this in perspective I looked up the USA stats for bird flu of 2009 on the CDC website These final estimates were that from April 12 2009 to April 10 2010 approximately 608 million cases range 433893 million 274304 hospitalizations 195086402719 and 12469 deaths 886818306 occurred in the United States due to pH1N1Also from the CDC While the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million  45 million illnesses between 140000  810000 hospitalizations and between 12000  61000 deaths annually since 2010So far this has been somewhat contained but we are not a police state and its near impossible both physically and politically to close down travel A lot of companies are cancelling events through April and limiting travel in order to protect workers What is unknown is if this will start to die out as the temperatures rise and there are more sunny days Ive heard various opinions Just be diligent in your personal hygiene|0

The early 2000s SARS outbreak coronavirus lasted three months and slowly disappeared as temperatures rose thank you springsummerThe flu is responsible for 650000 deaths per year with millions of serious cases This is apparently nothing serious and totally worth joking about but COVID19 is soooo dangerous that we have to shut down everything or were all going to die Imagine how incredibly stupid youre all going to look if by the end of 2020 the flu ends up having killed way more people than COVID19Since its all a joke to you doomers anyway heres the score to beatFlu kills 2020 650000 predicted annuallyCOVID19 2900 ongoing|0
Mind you these are fellow European Union countries that are doing this and theyre breaking the European law hereI did not point that out since I think what we need now is solidarity and cooperation for these trying times ahead While I firmly believe that the lack of any emergency supplies to handle a case where supply chains broke down is a monumental failing the blame isnt only on the government of Sweden here Im sure all these supplier and countries would have been extremely upset if countries started favoring their own industries for medical supplies But as you said this is highly dependent on not going renegade on earlier promises in a time of crisisUnrelenting to this current crisis I know Sweden for a contract to have the right to buy a certain amount of antivirals or flu vaccine in case of a flu pandemic Im fairly certain that those contracts will be very much regarded as useless after this debacle|0

Yeah I am convinced that the official numbers are being manipulated by using testing as a gate  Remember when China finally caved and had to start included clinical diagnoses in their reported numbers and the number of cases increased by 50 instantlyThe USs approach seems to be more about preventing panic than containing the virus|0
I think there was something about them getting more stock and they would just focus solely on delivering essentials to people All other nonessential items will get put on the back burner or 3rd party sellers can ship it themselves instead of drop shipping from Amazon I could be wrong tho I dont remember exactly what the article said|0

I read an interesting article from Canada about forced quarantines vs self quarantines Supposedly in the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic the death rate was a lot higher in the forced quarantine areas because sick people become afraid to go to the doctor because they dont want to be locked up In the looseygoosey selfquarantine areas people see the doctor if they need to and if the doctor tells them to stay home in bed supposedly the vast majority of them do exactly that and you actually get MORE quarantined people than you do with Wuhan style come out and well shoot you tactics With the heavyhanded methods people who should stay home figure out how to evade the quarantine and hide out somewhere else where they infect more peopleIve been of the opinion that selfquarantine is BS and we need real quarantines but now Im not so sure I havent seen a lot of discussion on it|0

Sitting in the ER currently in Shawnee OK Sent by our health dept to obtain Covid 19 testing due to meeting the guidelines for testing International travel to include 7 international airports7 planes Returned a week ago and fell ill last Thursday  Tested negative for the flu  Given tamiflu and antibiotic anyway No better today Sent here by our health dept to be tested and was told by the Dr hisself that he decides who is tested and who is not  It isnt up to anyone else The nurse argues with him that the only reasons my husband and I are here is for the virus test The dr states that trump has lied when he says the 5 million tests were sent out and that he saves his tests for the admitted patients only  The dr states our employers should be treating our work place as if we have the virus and the employers should be sterilizing anyhow   Still sick not better but worse Both of us have chronic illnesses One the 1 killer and the other is  3 killer GOD help us all Symptoms are chest pain and feeling like a weight in chest SOB fever chills dry cough  and zero energy|0

Head over to rCOVID19support  you might find it a bit more comforting than hereNo one is 100 confident of anything but lm confident that my interpretation is the best guess thats possible at the moment based on the figures we have and experience of previous outbreaks Elderly relatives need to be aware of how to protect themselves which can involve getting someone else to do their shopping for them for example so they dont have to go out as much but the more proactive you are in helping them the less out of control the situation is likely to seem Subs exclusively about coronoavirus arent really the best place for a hypochondriac to be  take a break in a sub local to where you live  ryourtown etc  and see what other people are saying It will remind you that real life still goes on|1

He also goes on to share during the question period that he doesnt  think there is a significant iceberg of mild cases that we arent  seeing in China because some community testing hasnt really shown that  This is alarming to me and something I was really hoping for I dont have time to watch the conference and maybe Im misunderstanding but isnt this a good thing It could indicate that the number of confirmed cases isnt actually lagging hugely behind actual infections as has always been assumed If thats the case it means that containment measures might be working better than people are giving them credit for|1

Okay so it probably is a little melodramatic and I get the idea of the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few but it is naive to think that small businesses and their employees can survive extended periods of lockdown and that this wont increase poverty which then impacts on all of the health welfare and social issues that goes with unemploymentYes It is naive to think so But you need a reality checkYou cant have your cake and eat it too as you tried to do with that melodramatic comment Bar workers are not likely to die from poverty if the bars have to close for a couple months and no one is saying it will be easyEither you are for social distancing and the prevention of community spread Or you are not Bars need to close There is no good alternative The longer we wait to implement effective social distancing the more people will dieAnd the longer we wait the more economic hardship there will be Riding the fence like you are doing with your previous comment means you havent come to terms with this yet|1
I think most people are missing out on the importance of basc preps like having a first aid kit or fire extinguishers  Something that would normally be minor may now induce a large risk ExNot having a spare 5 or 10Gal of fuel ifwhen the gas station is closed because the minimum wage staff are infected or refuse to go to work because of the exposure risk could make the difference in being able to drive an extra 30 min for supplies once a week or an all day adventure walking  Or being able to fuel a generator to keep the fridge running if the power goes outGoing to the ER may not really be a good idea  unnecessary exposure riskA small manageable fire that could be extinguished contained or controllled with a fire extinguisher can get out of control and be devistating if emergency response is taxed or overwhelmed  loss of shelter preps injuries and exposureOther countries dont necessarily have the same freedoms we have nor do the citizens always exercise their rights to protest or fight for those rights  Never underestimate the amount of chaos that can occur during times of turmoil  What if fuel food or meds are rationed  Who is going to decide who gets what  If  things get to that point do you think that process would be any different than the have and have nots that exist today or fair or free of corruption  I know that is all doomer talk and not everyone would agree but just being minimally prepared could make a huge difference  I would recommend any of the minimal preps above for a potential ice storm hurricane tornado etc    I am not a statistician so I will leave that to someone on here to post some estimates but I cant see how we could escape even minor supply disruptions at this point  Just looking at one thing China is the supply source for rare earth processing for the world  Smart phones tvs tablets etc   That is not going to be ramped up somewhere else  It is too expensive  The only reason its in China is because the government subsidized the construction of the processing plant for rare earths  Im probably off on the numbers and again someone can feel free to post a link or source but I want to say it was like a billion to build that plant  The irony of that is that the majority of the mineral resources of rare earths are in the US and afganistan   and for some thats probably news to them and fodder for conspitacy as to why there are ongoing military conflicts in afganistanBack on topicBe aware of what is going on and at a minimum do some basic preps  It will be money well spent|1

I appreciate your desire to look out for others and agree that it is important  With Amazon Pantry or CVS they are just dropping it off at your house so they do not have to risk contact with too many people  With Insta Cart I believe they work at the grocery store so there is some risk to them based on the fact that they are working in the store where people are shopping but the only way to eliminate that risk would be to shut down the grocery stores entirely|1

Sample size is fine Bias is whats difficultSee bias comes in thousands of ways But you say lets do more tests But what if the tests are not 100 correct They arent How correct do they need to be 99 90 What if I told you there are two types of false results that play very different roles False positives but also false negativesAnd this is where the entire difficulty comes from Not because we are unsure if some number is 04 05 or 06 It comes from the fact that if the test is 1 less reliable than we thought then the results might be completely void of sense and reasonIts not about statistics The bitch here is the systematic error You can call it offset or bias It universally kicks sciences butt|0

You do realize theyre not testing people at random though right The whole reason this is a scandal is because the CDCs requirements for testing are too strict So they only tested people with extremely high probabilities of having it And if you only test people with extremely high probability of having it of course youll find someone quickly Youre outraged for all the wrong reasons|0

I live in said hoity toity part of East London I think youre being a little harsh Shop shelves are noticeably empty and it is absolutely impossible to buy hand sanitiser I would agree that people are intensely laid back about things however Whilst in some pub toilets last night a chap told me that he had been to Northern Italy and probably had it  really makes you wonder how good of a job the government is actually doing at identifying potential cases That said I am refusing to panic In a city of 89 million people we have a grand total of 29 infections  thats not even 05 of the population Yes it could get worse theres also a chance it wont As things stand there isnt evidence of community transmission within the London area That said I really dont know what can be done At this point in time adopting wartime conditions does seem a tad extreme|1

There is absolutely no scientific evidence of rapid reinfection There are reported cases of people retesting as positive after being deemed recovered That is not the same thing It is jumping to wild baseless conclusions|1
Cool thanks Ill check it out |1
because they read about the news and are scared that they are infected have you seen the scenes at the hospital in Wuhanbut that is beside the point  my argument was that there are too many confirmed cases in too little a time to assume that most people who get infected go undetected and that would be good news if the indicators that the virus might spread asymptotically are accurate|0
Well right  Ive taken to thinking that theres so many variables playing into it right now and were so early in the outbreak that using the CFR is probably not valid for trying to predict the impact worldwide  in the USA so Im trying to just put some very rough bounds on it and imagine what that would look like The question goes beyond what the CFR is in the average developed western country though from a how many people will die standpoint that is basically the question What Im getting at is what does the average developed western country look like while this is in full swing|1

I dont know whats going to blow up around here  As a personal policy I try to assume our public servants are doing their very best As the husband of a teacher I know for sure those teachers and staff members care more about the kids than anyone other than the parents If a teacher died of an infection of any kind the other staff has to be devastated And as devastated as they are their first priority is caring for the kids who had to watch their teacher collapse in class Weve my wife almost entirely dealt with a lot of kids over the years It is HARD to watch them suffer|0

People are jumping the gun on this and assuming ALL patients get lung fibrosis from COVID19 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THIS Many dare I say most hospitalized patients are in the hospital simply because they have pneumonia which may impair their oxygenation unassisted This can and frequently does happen with no physical damage to the lungs but rather as an overactive response by the body The doctors will tell you specifically if you are experiencing notable fibrosis and even if you did there is nothing to suggest that the fibrosis continues after the infection is resolved  it develops in response to the damage that again CAN not will be caused while you are infected So even if you do take a fibrosis hit its not comparable to a disease that causes unceasing fibrosis like autoimmune disordersSo to answer your question if you are cured of coronavirus and are back on your feet again you can pretty much expect that to be the end of it still more research about possible residual effects but we are seeing quite a few very oldsick people in China seemingly close to their previous levels after being discharged If however you get hit very very hard and it goes beyond just moderate pneumonia then yes you could be looking at chronic issues but again no evidence that they would be progressive|0

Allegedly plateauingI think that info is probably legit but keep in mind this is the CCP Theyve been lying about this thing from the beginning They also have a lot more peopleThat being said you might be right The bad initial test kits were a pretty colossal fuck up and the average person in the US seems far too blaiseis not taking proper precautionsId like to think quarantines will come into effect at some point and people will follow them voluntarilywithout the same level of coercion weve seen from China but who the hell knows At this point that would just help it plateau down the road A lot of people are almost definitely gonna get pretty sick soon and theres not much we can do at this point but try to slow it downThere are still a couple rays of hope1 The US has better healthcare infrastructure than most of China provided supply chains arent too fucked up 2 The lack of universal health care might be a blessing in disguise only those in serious condition will want to go in and get treatment so hospital beds might not fill up quite as quickly3 Many people in third tier cities and the countryside in China do not wash their hands and hygiene standards in general are much lower4 Many of the elderly people most at risk are already segregated into retirement homes which are easier to quarantineare already taking precautions due to flu season unlike in China where most elderly are at home and are supported by working ie previously out and about before quarantines family members5 The virus could mutate and become weaker or people in the US might not be quite as susceptible to it due to geneticsAll of those points particularly the last one are admittedly weak The strongest one is probably our better hygiene standards but theyre not perfect and idk how much that really matters The Japanese are insanely hygienic and theyre still getting hit but I do think good hygiene at least slows it down|1

I like your approach Been thinking along the same lines lately  the authorities have let us down hugely so what can we do for ourselves and each other Anyway here are a bunch of ideas just brainstorming dont take any of them word for word Im just hoping they might spark something usefulTestingI dont have any biochemmed background but it seems like RTPCR is a fairly common lab technique Maybe university labs private labs pharmaceutical companies etc have supply to donate Alternatives to testing1 From what Ive heard before they give people a newcorona test they usually do some other test for flu etc Do those use different lab materials If we cant test for corona directly can we at least push for some form of minimal and easytoget flu test It wouldnt rule out corona completely but it could help dampen peoples worry because at least flu is a known quantity Most people have an idea of how their body reacts to the usual kind of respiratory infection so positive flu test  normal course of illness could let them return to work WITHOUT the extra quarantine once symptoms resolve And if they start showing new symptoms that are unusual for them they have extra ammo to help persuade a testerCould backfire if people get complacent knowing they just have the flu I dunno2 Seems like a lot of top level screening is by symptom but we dont necessarily have good data on what symptoms present when and at what severity Maybe we could make some kind of symptomdatabase app Like encourage people to take their temperature a few times daily and submit it along with their location and a 110 rating for each symptom including the rarer ones like sneezing or diarrhea Personal history could be useful for doctors and community history could be useful for tracking spreads For those who do get tested eventually we could correlate symptom history with genetic sequence PPE shortageLots of complaints that healthcare staff doesnt have masks etc because people have bought them all Maybe we can convince some of those people or others who happen to have spare supplies of their own to donate them to hospitals Coupled with some good explanations of how masks work and how to make your own if you really need one there are a few academic papers around might get some converts AntifacetouchingI touch my face constantly without realizing it So maybe we should think of easy reminders Best and easiest way Ive come up with is to hold your arm straight and put a bandaid on the OUTSIDE of your elbow running along your arm the long way When you bend your arm more than 90 degrees it pulls on your skin and annoys you just enough for you to stop and think about whether you really need to pick your noseAnything that makes it slightly awkward to bend your arm can help here Elbowcuffs Skating elbowpads worn backwards|1

Just to add some caution to this study The sample size was 12 people who had all been hospitalised with COVID19  and we dont know if they had any underlying health concerns such as COPD A reduction in lung capacity is normal after respiratory illnesses and in healthy people lungs have great potential to recover in the long term|1

Yes  Did you watch the simulation  It explains it much better than Im going to  But Ill give it a bashInfected spread the disease  But only to people they contact and only until they recover  So if we can limit the amount of contacts each infected will pass it to on average less than 1 other person and the virus dies outYou cant catch it sitting in your basement playing computer games  You can only catch it by interacting with infected people or stuff theyve recently coughedsneezed on  So if we all become extreme introverts for a month or two the virus will die out as the infected recover without having been able to spread the diseaseThe sim does a good job of showing how it still works even though its basically impossible for ALL of us to isolate  The few people moving around will still have a chance to catch and spread the disease  The first few infected still spread it to everyone they encounter  But if those secondary contacts are all isolated and dont infect anyone else the chain dies out|0
While I completely agree they cant keep up with supply during a pandemic Their cost metrics were based on normal use estimates They are probably making them as fast as they can and demand wont stop even if hospitals start using the 3d printed ones|1

It depends for example Bolsonaro is practically Trump so Brazil will stay normal until is way too late Bolivia is reporting its first cases of coronavirus but it has been politically unstable since the Evo Morales coup and Chile has a similar political instability so the focus on the virus is lower Argentina has installed a quarantine but its only if you come from the top infected countries i think China SK Iran France Germany Spain etc Chile and Boliva may at most put prohibitions from people coming from Europe and Asia if you are in South America already and you came here before the virus exploded into a crisis you are probably safer here lol Hope you enjou your trip and stay safe Also try thinking coming to El Salvador to visit after all this situation clears up hahahaha|1
You thought wronghttpswwwbritannicacomsciencecasefatalityrate  It can only really be calculated after the virus has basically been burnt out The number is known to be inaccurate at this time for a bunch of reasons  1  We have no idea how many people are actually infected  In many countries there is inadequate testing  So the number of reported cases are really low2  This virus has a long incubation period   So its entirely possible that the CFR will be 2 or lower  In most countries we dont have enough data to make a statistically viable conclusion about the virusI dont know WTF is going on in Iran  I heard that they have a practice of using steroids which is apparently not something you want to do|0

For someone with mild symptoms home is likely the safest place to be ill and recover  Early data from Chinahttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov32064853theepidemiologicalcharacteristicsofanoutbreakof2019novelcoronavirusdiseasescovid19inchina reports that over 80 of people had a mild case  OTC fever medications and cough medications can help someone be more comfortable and control symptoms at home and hospital acquired infections like MRSA are a risk with inpatient care  If someone doesnt need skilled medical care staying at home allows them to avoid those risks which are small but do existA ventilator isnt something the average person can purchase or that the average person can safely use without medical supervision  If a person needs that level of medical support calling 911 or having someone drive them to the ER is the best optionWHO has explicitly recommended againsthttpswwwwhointdocsdefaultsourcecoronaviruseclinicalmanagementofnovelcovpdf the routine use of steroids for COVID19 unless theyre indicated for another reason  Here is another source with the same recommendatiohttpswwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlePIIS0140673620303172fulltextn  The CDC agrees that Corticosteroids should be avoided because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERSCoV patients unless indicated for other reasonshttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovhcpclinicalguidancemanagementpatientshtmlclinicalmanagementtreatment3CAntibiotics may be necessary for some people but the best type to take will depend on exactly what secondary infection they have and that requires medical care  Again a hospital or doctor would be the best source of adviceThe guidance page explicitly recommends seeking medical attention if symptoms worsen or 911 in case of a medical emergency  Hospitals in most areas still have capacity to care for people who are that sick so the safest option would be going there to get skilled care  The advice to stay home if you dont need skilled medical care and to get that care if you do is solid|1

Several US patients have recovered from coronavirus but so far the CDC has shared detailed clinical information about only one of those patients That information includes what treatments the patients received and how they faredThe CDC is the federal agency that communicates with physicians about how to handle outbreaks Whether its SARS Ebola or last years measles outbreak the agency uses information from cases around the world  and in particular the United States  to advise doctors on how to diagnose evaluate and treat diseasesThe federal agency possesses such information about several US coronavirus patients but has not released it That means doctors who now unexpectedly find themselves treating new coronavirus patients arent able to benefit from the findings of doctors who preceded themIts a medical truism that its absolutely essential that physicians with experience with a particular condition disseminate information to others said Dr Irwin Redlener director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia UniversityNot sharing such information is is inexplicable and inappropriate Redlener addedThe CDC did not respond to CNNs requests for comment|1

At the least its going to deter other Chinese from making the same attempt Which initself is extremely effectiveEven if the Chinese infected some of the other passengers on the plane which isnt a given By not allowing the Chinese in the number of infected that get to enter the country will be much lower and so easier to contain Moreover theres nothing to suggest that these arrivals are not going to be tester especially those that set near the ChineseDo you understand the meaning of Xenophobia Israel is not barring all Chinese just those that visited China in the last 14 days Do you realize that China itself is using quarantine as a measure in its cities While is it ok for China to quarantine Chinese but it is not ok for others|1

For those touting these are just lab conditions the real takeaway from the journal preprint is that this virus is behaving very similarly to SARSCoV1 the OG SARSThe surface stability was performed at 21 to 23C and relative humidity of 40 which are pretty common indoor conditions this time of yearThe aerosol tests were performed in some drum apparatus which is likely going to be harder to compare to real world conditions but you can still compare the to SARSCoV1 in a meaningful wayhttpswwwmedrxivorgcontent1011012020030920033217v2|1

I was wondering this myself at least when it comes to the people who are able But then I figured if you give people permission to take their kids out of school youll get lots doing it even when they arent able to stay home out of fear And there will likely be a large portion who will still allow the grandparents to look after them or the kids will socialise in each others homes when this goes on for months on end Spreading the virus anyway perhaps even worse then if they were in schoolId love to see what the governments predictive modelling looks like Theres an element of they need people to roughly follow along the lines of predicted behaviour Because if you start adding large elements of chaos its difficult to predict the outcome|0

According to the Reddit post Ill link Remdesivir was used on the first patient in Washington and from what I gathered the patient greatly improved I did not see an update on the person though Im still trying to source the info about the doctor I mentioned but I havent found it yet Im going to keep digging though and update post if I find itOK GOT IT looks like I got my info mixed A comment had been made about Washington State in the post Im linking about the patient they used Remdesivir on who recoveredThe comment about the doctor who recovered was actually located in Iran in this same thread I thought his father was in Washington which was incorrect udexgen   statedIm from Iran and they are primarily using chloroquineMy dad is infected by Coronavirus he is a doctor who is at a much higher risk He is currently recovering at home after being hospitalised for 6 days They gave him Hydroxychloriquine Amantadine and Oseltamivir and he got better afterwardsAnd later saidBecause he was given a mix of drugs he takes 200mg hydroxychloroquine daily instead of the usual 400 or 500mgOne other thing to note is that his condition went bad for two to three days before getting better afterwards so the effectiveness should not be that high but works He said he was one of the severe casesAbout other cases I dont know anyone who I can get their prescriptions but when I talked with my dads supervisor nurse in hospital and local pharmacy they said doctors usually prescribe hydroxychloroquine among other drugsThis doesnt appear to be verified information though but I suppose its possible to verify through the userIts a long thread but all of this can be located in the link right belowI apologize I got things mixed up a little and will update my original post Ive just read entirely too much at this point and things are starting to blur for meBut anyway hereshttpswwwredditcomrCOVID19commentsfe47u6chloroquineandhydroxychloroquineasavailableutmmediumandroidapputmsourcesharethe link to the Reddit post that speaks about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and the Doctor who received this type of treatmentThey also speak of the Chinese treatment plan using the chloroquine and provide linksThe original source is linked but you need to translate it I did not verify any of the links but Im also not stating any of this as actual factI do not want to spread misinformation at all just sharing what I found so that others may go research themselvesAlso see hereKorean treatment guidelines which include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquinehttpmkoreabiomedcomnewsarticleViewhtmlidxno7428|1

Theres a somewhat widespread inability for people to accept a reality that they dont want to be true regardless of the facts and they will consider any attempt to change their mind as highly insulting or patronisingOf course thats a massive generalisation  there are plenty of normal sane people But especially in politics people tend to choose what reality they would prefer to live in and disregard and shout down anything that threatens their ability to continue living in that realityAlso dont forget a lot of people are quite stupid|0

We share somewhat similar stories Between January 23February 11 I visited Thailand Laos Singapore and Tokyo On the flight back to Chicago I began feeling tired and assumed it was just jet lag However after I got back I started feeling more aches and fatigue and I guess malaise is a good term for it No fever yet but my mouth throat and even my eyes feel very dry I dont even cough often but a cough here and there from the dry throat does happen occasionally I feel kind of crappy but nothing severe at all really Out of an abundance of caution I called my doctor yesterday Had to leave a voicemail because they were too busy to answer  His nurse finally called back this morning to ask me what was going on I explained to her where I had been and how I was feeling She chalked it up mostly to jet lag but said she would talk to the doc and get back to me That was at 830 eastern time this morning and no call back yet 12 hours later Im not really sure what to do if anything Im probably overreacting but dont want to be careless eitherI guess my question for you would be when did you decide to call 111 Was it just because of a cough Or the fever Since I dont have a fever Im not terribly worried but that can change of course Trying to decide about quarantining myself for two weeks potentially for nothing and putting my job in jeopardy vs taking a chance on infecting others is a tough call to make|0

So this answered a question Id been meaning to ask for a while how feasible would it to be to make a test faulttolerant against one or more of the reagents probesprimer being contaminatedlooks like it would be  there are enough conserved regions of the virus genome to pick from that you could test 6 or 7 and ignore rows of the plate that had control failures stuck high or low|0

A sensible approach may be to allow children to stay at home without comeback for the parents and with suitable study materialsremote support from the education authorities while keeping schools open for those who rely on free school meals or have parents in key jobsIt might end up at a point where schools need to be kept open during the holidays if only to provide childcare for those with parents in healthcare and vital infrastructure Lots of kids being off school and being looked after by grandparents is going to increase the risk for the mostly elderly grandparents significantly and I doubt there is enough spare capacity in childcareUnfortunately with the reduction in funding over many years I doubt the education authorities have enough resources in place to cope with something like this  but hopefully it will be a reminder that contingency planning is important even if it is rarely needed|1

Worth reading this from Wikipedias entry on pangolin In February 2020 university researchers in China employing genomic sequencing found a 99 match between coronavirus found in pangolins and SARSCoV2 the virus responsible for the 201920 coronavirus outbreak6 Although a 99 similarity is not necessarily enough to link them a subsequent wholegenome comparison found that the pangolin and human viruses in fact share only 903 of their DNA thus ruling out the animals as a direct source7 The initial speculation about pangolins being the origin of the virus may have led to mass slaughters similar to what happened to civets during the SARS outbreak 8|1

The reality is she may not escape getting sick but shes in an age range where shes should survive the virus The question is if shed rather get sick in China or at home or in quarantine She will get substantially better medical care somewhere thats not China since China is overwhelmed with cases Id make a break for it even if I risked getting sick along the way|1

As soon as youre symptomatic then you have enough viral load to pass it onYes you pass it on What does that have to do with people dropping like flies The initial symptoms are a fever andor cough It takes a while for it to get worse if it gets worse This takes time Remember just a month ago there were less than 40 diagnosed cases in China It takes time to manifest Plus most people infected outside of China may not know theyve come in contact with someone infected so odds are they wont be diagnosed If anything well see a surge in pneumonia cases in a few weeks if this thing isnt contained but at the present moment no one outside of China will be dropping like flies|0
I realize you got this text from the article no quotation marks The last sentence is misleading In the first two sentences O is referred to first then A In the last sentence which provides the important information we must assume from the conclusion of the study that 38 refers to A and 25 refers to O That is the trouble with using it as a shortcut when writing about scientific findings|0

Hi Im Lucia Im a 23 year old living in Veneto in the north of Italy Maybe youve heard of Venice  its a pretty cool place its a 20 minutes drive from where I live I cant go there though In fact I cant go anywhere I cant take a walk go jogging check the latest sale at the local bookstore My entire country is under lockdown Think about that the 8th economy of the world a nation of 60 million people that since a few weeks ago where enjoying the arrival of springtime by going outside with their friends reading in parks and yes traveling to their beautiful cities  completely shut downYou know Italians Were dramatic folks and we love life Wed never in a million years give up the sweetness of sunlight of chats with our friends of restaurants and strolls down the streets And yet we did Because while we thought that this thing was just a common flu maybe a bit harsher than usual it was claiming the lungs of our grandparents our dads and moms our professors our doctors our friends Weve reached more than 1000 deaths More than 15000 have been infected I fear for my relatives and for my own safety as I have asthma If something happens to me so be it But if we could all go back and prevent this from getting to where its gotten even just by avoiding big gatherings not going to crowded malls making sure we didnt infect someone we could have reasonably avoided infectingGod We wouldThis is a beautiful developed country Its shut down This is the second best healthcare system in the world Its collapsing under the weight of the virus You have time Not much but you have it This thing is already everywhere so you have you HAVE this is fundamental to prevent it from spreading as much as possible Do it for your neighbors for your kids your relatives every person that ever meant something for you and for me too Read the news Check foreign newspapers We can get through this but we need responsibility decency intelligence and people taking a stand right now I trust youll do what needs to be done to stop this virus as much as its realistically in your power With love  Con amore Luciagarlicdjango use it wherever you want and godspeed stay safe|1

This is an interesting finding since a recent study well data collection up to Feb 3rd using phylodynamic modeling indicated this about SARSCOV2x200B The SEIR model incorporated two classes of infectious individuals in order to produce a realistic variance of the offspring distribution which corresponds to the SARSlike k016 The model has a high transmission rate group comprising 135 of infected individuals who transmit at a rate 74 times larger than the remaining infected individuals   httpswwwimperialacukmediaimperialcollegemedicinesphidegidafellowshipsImperialCollegeCOVID19geneticanalysisFINALpdfhttpswwwimperialacukmediaimperialcollegemedicinesphidegidafellowshipsImperialCollegeCOVID19geneticanalysisFINALpdf x200BThere was some discussion on reddit whether or not this superspreader effect was behavioral or physiological presumably with some genetic component perhaps even somewhat predictiveAnother paper from 2005 in Nature indicates the superspreading property of a pathogen is amenable to individualspecific control measures during an outbreak httpswwwnaturecomarticlesnature04153httpswwwnaturecomarticlesnature04153|0

I agree I was in the ICU for 9 hours this weekend getting tested for everything BUT coronavirus after I had the flu shortly after a trip to South Korea I only have the cough symptoms now thankfully but Im telling you right now these numbers in the US are not correct They are shipping my blood samples and swabs to the CDC but idk how long that will take They just put me on a mandatory quarantine however Im getting very worried they arent taking this seriously enough I live with my pregnant partner and her son and they arent even recommending they stay home since they dont have symptoms they are not equipped to handle this at all|0

I just came home to find dad had bought a box of masks from Canadian Tire Before anyone asks me which store he spent 40 CAD on a box of 50 surgical masks I remember reading that Canadian Tire had previous mislabeled n95s at the beginning of February It looks like theyre back at the price gouging again My dad is of the retirement age yet still working due to shitty government retirement plans He is definitely in the at risk group CT is once again trying to take advantage of the pandemic taking advantage of the elderly What shameful behaviour for a major retailer   What Im personally outraged about beyond the price gouging is the fact that the box was poorly packaged There was no sealing done to separate the masks nor to prevent them from general exposure Just a simple box A very dented box The least dented box that dad could find from the pile In fact I couldnt even tell if they were new masks or used and sold for reuse|0
The reports are confirming what the WHO and CDC are saying That most people will have MILD symptoms with light coughing and a fever for a few days The people saying the mild symptoms arent mild are the ones contradicting the reports and the CDC and the WHO Im trust trying to keep things real here and prevent the panic and possible stupidity which I have seen this week of people coming to work sick and coughing with mild symptoms thinking they couldnt possible have the covid19 because they dont feel that sick just a cough Dangerous in its own right to tell people that the minimum bad is worse than it is|0

Runny nose is not a common symptom but has been found in 5 of known cases but yes in all likelihood it was a cold that is not the point the point is that if most are only experiencing symptoms similar to what I and my family has experienced over the past 2 weeks or even milder there is no way all those with only mild to no symptoms are seeking medical attention for this and there is no way they will ever be included in the confirmed cases count A few days of feeling crummy for most is not going to send them to seek testing for this Do you know any lower income and working class people They arent going to the hospital or doctor for a cough and slight fever for a few days they are going to pound some cough medicine and motrin and go back to work Hell we have people who have known theyve been exposed just going about their day why would people who had no clue they were exposed seek attention for what they think is a cold Only reason we brought our son to the doctor is because he is asthmatic and has a history with pneumonia those without that kind of concern arent going to be as prudent we are also lucky to have excellent health insurance so cost isnt a concern to us|0

The problem is a financial one for many people Say you booked a 10k trip months ago before anyone had even heard of this virus Depending on the trip cancelling at this point can mean losing half of that money or more because many items are nonrefundable The vast majority of people are going to choose to take the trip over losing 5kAnd how do you fix the problem You cant force every travel company to give full refunds theyre already in dire straights and that will bankrupt them Does the government pay for the refunds then That means taxpayers bail out the travel companies in the midst of an increasingly grim economy|0
In some ways China had it the easiest They could deal with a single place of origin for the virus did not have to worry about international travel importing was able to use their entire supply chain of masks testing reagents etc on their own people and can now enact strong quarantinesThe rest of the world is getting it from all different directions with a broken supply chain a lack of masks etc|1

Im sorry to hear that Because chinese buy all masks they see and send to China after the break out And now masks are  strictly controlled by every governments If you are in Germany I just known last week in some DM you can buy 1 pack of masks per person masks are not on the shelf but you can buy them directly from the cashier And last week I saw the page of Bauhaus there are a little stores in Berlin still have ffp 1 masks If you have chinese friends you can ask them the way to buy some masks last week my girlfriend in Netherlands buy some masks from local Asian supermarket But you need to be aware that there are a lot of inferior masks now trading at high prices privately Because the Chinese know how terrible this virus is many Chinese have stocked some masks If you cant buy some try to get some masks from your chinese friends although not many but I believe it is still useful when you go to the hospital Im not sure if this is good to say these here Scarce supplies can lead to violence which is also considered by European governments But china gives other countries 2 mouths to prepare and they do nothingAll the governments and politicians are same all countries have repeated the mistakes of the Chinese government Scheisse|0

The thing is most countries have sick leave as a right and plenty of businesses are able to survive In Australia we have a trade off where people can be hired as casuals which means no sick leave but as a result the minimum wage for them is higher and they get penalty rates at night time or on Sundays|0

Great simulation Very clear If we do not put in place some level of quarantine and social distancing notice how the simulation ends with everyone infected Think about what happens to the elderly then|1
Well lets play this gameImagine that everyone with a cough or fever would brush it of ignore it and go to hospital only if theyre dying  what do you will happenNo need to think you have your answer This whole outbreak happened because people actually went to hospital Look at the results  and this is already a situation of hysteria by China that quarantined the city while even the head of WHO said theyre against any constraints on trade or travelWhat do you think happens if China abandoned the hysteria and followed the WHO or your recommendationAnd remember theres no need to the public to panic if their government did the correct thing and decided to protect them first Therell be no need to fear|0
No shit|0

I dont know how to my colleagues are having a conversation saying how its stupid to take it seriously and stuff Just feel like if I say anything Ill be ridiculed|0
Our percapita carbon emissions are still too high Also China does an awful lot of manufacturing at our request which boosts their numbers Which isnt to say they should ignore the situation just that we all need to work on it as hard as possible rather than attributing blame Same as the coronavirus  the US administration didnt do a great job but at this point the media has spent way more effort attributing blame than highlighting possible solutions|0
Most people dont even take flu seriously Its just flu equates to its just a bad cold when flu can be truly awful like your friends Ive had my jabshot like I do every year asthmatic but Im even more glad since its one less disease Im exposed to Plus if I develop flulike symptoms it probably isnt flu|1

I know a lot of COVID19 clinics in Victoria Australia which are already running out of kits and masks the hotline has a 72 hr backlog They only intent to test the most high risk cases overseas travel close contacts Plus have a friend working in Maroondah hospital who are having trouble sourcing masks|0
In from canada and Ive never had a problem with healthcare here Just yesterday coincidentally I went to walk in clinic because i got a steel flake in my eye at work and they had to get it out it literally took 20 minutes start to finish Any time Ive had a serious injury they take you in right away x ray and check for internal bleeding If that checks out then you wait a bit to have it set get casted whatever And even then the longest I waited was like 3 hours Small price to pay considering my family doesnt have to foot the bill for my retired grandma whos been in the hospital for 3 weeks in a private room|1
It seems like rationality was burned at the stake a while ago People either think its just a bad flu or its the end of the world I dont get why the deniers attack people who are rationally concerned for themselves or loved ones are viewed so negativelyI also am annoyed as a healthcare workers by those buying up n95 masks without knowing how to fit them to make them effective We have to get fitted and tested for n95s yearly The general public is going to end up just wasting resources like that and hurting the long term outcomesPrepping with food and water and avoiding busy places is the rational thing to do|0
This is all more or less my more specific opinion on the matter Well saidIf theres one thing thats certain this pandemic will change the political narrative for years to come  and perhaps well finally inch away from the status quo|1

And so begins the death spiral of health care workers being taken out of commission Putting on more stress on remaining HCWs in the system not infected only to be infected themselves because people are refusing to take precautions Then deaths will start piling up because we dont have the HCWs that are healthy to provide care The bungling of the CDC and our health care system is really a sight to behold|1
If they knew they would have told you If they were serious about it they would have had a plan for worst case scenario by February 23 when Wuhan was under lockdown for a month and it was pretty obvious things were going shitwards They are still clueless Xi Jinping went on news and said when he knew by Jan 5th that things were not on a regional scale anymore he made it a national priority decided to lockdown entire cities Such a leadership is lacking Instead this country is holding AIPAC rallies and the president is going away to visit the Taj Mahal speaking to the media in a MAGA hat|0

The  progression of the HIVAIDS crisis and this Corona virus have mirrored each other pretty closely Blaming one demographic its a chineseold persons disease vs gay disease the CDC putting politics before science refusing to test folks this whole buisness about masks vs refusing to test the blood supply a republican president who tried to ignore the problem until it got way too bad etc At the beginning of this outbreak I had hoped that the American government would have learned from the sins of the past However all that has happened is that the events of the 80s have repeated themselves|0

Fitting the mask to face touching the mask adjusting the mask not washing hands each time you handle the mask Reusing masks The list of terrible practices is quite long Most of the surgical masks wont prevent you from small droplets Wearing a mask is really more effective if you are sick and want to contain your transmission to others|0
Thank you so much |1
3M is already making as many masks as it could in its US factories and worldwide like in Europe The fact of the matter is that there is not enough masks to go around for 7 billion people even if every single mask making machine is running for 24 hours a dayThe only way around this is for normal people to use some sort of reusable fabric barrier  either a fabric face mask ot just a scarf around your mouth and nose Fibres are a hostile environment for viruses naturally trapping droplets and drying out the virus particles Thats what the authorities should be recommending|0

From 10 families how much do you think will take appropriate measuresIf your answer is less than 10 and for sure it will be than that means that there is a possibility than one out of 10 families will go somewhere with their kids If this is true which is that means that if someone will get sick  you wouldnt know that instead of being informed in school Which also means that hidden spread will have more possiblities than before Which also mean you will not know about possible infections around you  You cant close schools and not open quarantine  it will be even worse  If you open quarantine than its automatically means you close schools|0

Im basing that off of the CDC and the UC Davis Medical Center statements both of which said that the patient had no known contact and no known source They literally dont have a source to give us the Bay Area is a huge hotspot for international travel and it was considered inevitable itd reach here eventually There is no indication that the quarantine was broken by anyone at any point nor has any other American quarantine been broken Burden of proof lies on those making the initial claim and the initial claim was that Travis broke their quarantine there is literally no evidence at all for that and some evidence to the contrary So yeah I will tell you to not speculate and panic yourself and others more|0

So you have to understand two important factors here1 the virus is generally exceptionally mild for up to 2 weeks AFTER you start showing symptoms before rapidly getting worse2 Iran like most of the western World has access to very high quality and affordable OTC cold and flu medication and almost no one goes to the hospital for a cold or flu unless they are very sick The infected people probably assumed that as its cold and flu season they had one of those illnesses and medicated with good OTC stuff that suppressed their symptoms until they were on deaths door I imagine that in much of the west this is how we will find cases|0

The IT business as a whole is not characterised by moral rectitude The fact that the likes of Gates et al donate to charity doesnt change this Im perfectly willing to take an objective view of charitable acts for what they are  but context is everything You cant remove the context of wealth and still retain true meaning of resultant charitable acts If we did this with everything machiavellianism would not exist as a concept Bezos recent donation to environmental causes is another example I refuse to laud the cut throat acquisition of disproportionate wealth just because some of it is later spent on causes that have an ancillary effect of charity The religious side of Gates motivation smacks of the same hypocrisy  I struggle with apportionment of credibility to religions that preach charity on one hand and retain huge disproportionate wealth on the otherBranding is everything  and both the religious motivation for Gates overt morality and his resultant charitable acts pseudocharitable remains a strong argument follow exactly the same pattern I dont buy either of them and refuse to arrest my analysis at a superficial level that denies holism|1

I have a slightly elevated temperature 9951001 and a cough with no other symptoms except I had some aches the 2nd night of having it and I got it tested and its influenza So it could just be that A flu test is fast and easy though get one if you can Once you have a flu test it should be easy to get a doctors order for a COVID test but whether or not your state can do tests on just anyone with a negative flu test will depend on the specific state and their testing capacity|0

 There is this idea that getting tested for Covid 19 is going to help the individual It doesnt typically It is more of a public health tool If you feel bad and you get tested and its positive that changes nothing in the treatment Rest fluids and monitor If you genuinely feel sick stay home and self quarantine If breathing becomes difficult call your doctor and they will tell you if you should go into the hospital Testing needs to be reserved for the immunocompromised And for the love of god dont go to the hospital if you just are feeling sick|1

If you shut everything down early you just shunt the peak rather than flattening it And the length of the time a country can shutdown without their economy imploding is limited So blowing your load early and wasting your limited shutdown time would be both ineffective at mitigating the disease and would damage the economy pointlesslyThe uk is pretty far behind all these other countries in the infection curve so the optimal time to do it is later and timed very precisely to make best use of itShutting down for 18 months in the hopes of getting a vaccine would be just impossible without killing the economy|1

No that wouldnt end the transmission chain  If you stop contact for 14 days anybody who has been exposed should get it within those 14 days  But people who live with other people could be exposed during that time  And essential workers could be exposed during that time  That leaves people in the middle of the contagious period at the end of those 14 days  The goal of a lock down wouldnt be to eliminate the virus  thats likely not a possibility  The goal as I have heard it would be to significantly slow down how fast people are getting it so that the health care system is not overwhelmed|0

Well nobody knows what the case is this is all speculation The herd immunity plan goes something like this if you are sick with whatever symptoms self quarantine This way hospitals arent bombarded with people coming in for non life threatening conditions The logic is that it will stagger the number the number of people being hospitalized instead of a huge influx So far experts believe that kids do not get life threatening symptoms so they will be a group of people expected to be quarantined and only go to hospital if symptoms worsen Im not sure if Im explaining it correctly so heres an article from UK httpswwwindependentcouknewshealthcoronavirusherdimmunityuknhsoutbreakpandemicgovernmenta9399101html|0

Man this is so fucking dramatic and cringey Look a very small percentage of people will die Thats inevitable We cant stop it now its too late Twice as many people die in automobile accidents every year than H1N1 killed during 2009 Its unfortunate we dont want people to die but we cant turn the ship around The consequences of forced shutdown are far far bleeker than any relatively and comparably small amount of death worldwide Again I aim to not downplay the death its all tragic and yes I fear for my familys health If we have a societal shut down it will cause a global depression the likes of which have never been seen Businesses will have to cut employees countless more will fold altogether causing mass unemployment homelessness and economic collapse Jobs would be more scarce than in 2008 and the virus would still spread Truly we are already fucked until we can actually cure this Yes we could mitigate the spread by forcing societal shutdown But at what cost|0

He probably jumped back into work before fully recovering its entirely plausible that he worked harder than he should have and caused his immune system to slow down thus the virus took stronghold back thats why rest is sooooooooo important|1
Personally I think it is important to trace contact points If you know someone has covid19 and they were asymptomatic and were in the community or went to work you should test persons who have been in contact with the infected Then you can isolate and avoid further spreading Putting your head in the sand and pretending that people cant possibly be infected is plain stupidI agree random sampling makes no sense but we are talking about a situation where someone was in direct contact with someone who tested positive for covid19|1

Well the state medical board sent out an new advisory to test all persons with respiratory symptoms a fever and a negative flu test for COVID19 Hopefully that will improve the figures The problem is though only certain criteria  serious cases or confirmed contacts etc go to the state lab The rest has to go to LabCorp They apparently have the ability to process several thousand tests a day but thats for the whole country My hospital does not have the capability to test in house I think thats pretty typical All our molecular diagnostics run on preengineered test systems and they havent got tests available for them yet Also I have no idea how our stores of testing supplies are like across the state I know we dont send out viral swabs often at place of work so we didnt have a whole lot of vials to start with I can imagine its a similar situation in a lot of areas Hopefully when I go back to work on Monday well have a better idea of how to get testing done and a shipment of supplies|1
Ok thanks for the explanation Thats fucked up|0
Does her coworker display symptoms yet This would count as secondary exposure  I dont have data yet but going off a pretty similar incident in my university I think your mom is safe But why is she still working She should be at homeIf she starts showing symptoms contact your hospital through phone immediately|1
It doesnt harm your immune system per se its an immunomodulator not a suppressant Additionally hydroxychloroquine has a cumulative effect meaning you would need to take it every for a prolonged period of time 12 weeks in order for it to have any lasting effect of immunomodulation when use for autoimmune disorders From what Ive read when taken for treating Covid19 people are only taking it for a matter of days It seems to stop proliferation of the virus somehow Who knows what the long term consequences are at this point but I dont see why it wouldnt work if you had a subsequent infection Perhaps its not a perfect treatment but it seems to be better than nothing at the moment and it is a very common and very safe medication|1
Ok I get that theres a at longest 14 day incubation period for this but why the fuck hasnt Italy slowed down|0

The COVID19 Coronavirus is a huge threat to you and those you love It is not the flu It is much worseIm taking a few minutes now to write here because too many people are sticking their heads in the sand about this Even some hospital workers are downplaying the severity That behavior is bravado and it is stupid and inexcusably recklessIm also taking the time now because I genuinely believe were not going to be able to deal with the surge pretty soon I feel I must say that I am not very prone to hysterics I deal with severely ill and dying people for a living and I am telling you this is a big dealI dont mean to insult those who know that already but many havent grasped the seriousness of this situationThings are going to get much worse over the coming days and weeks There is no cause to panic and panic only makes things worse Instead use your head Do not say this will all be fine and youre not going to modify your behaviorDont gather with people Avoid inperson contact wherever possible That includes public transit and if you absolutely must use it anyway at least try to avoid peak hours I know this isnt realistic for everyone Do what you canDo Not Touch Your Face Theres nothing funny about this I know its hard to be vigilant Dont touch your face anyway If you dont have a reliable presence of mind to not do it wear winter gloves to remind yourself or something Anything Just dont touch your faceDisinfect inanimate nonfood objects youre concerned might be contaminated with a dilute bleach solution Wash your hands often with soap and clean water and make sure youre washing vigorously each time and for as long as it takes to sing the happy birthday song twice Use hand sanitizer when you cant use a sink if possibleWhy is this so important Maybe youre 25 years old Your risk of death is below 1 rightFirst you can spread the disease for days and days before you start to feel sick Maybe youll spread it to people at higher risk or maybe the lowrisk people you infect will infect others at higher risk Avoiding spread is the most effective way of preventing deaths and if you have a conscience you will feel terrible if someone gets sick or dies because of your negligenceSecond your risk of getting seriously ill is much higher than your risk of dying No one wants the young to die We as doctors know they can almost always be saved with maximal carethe kind that takes up a ton of resources When that happens youre going to require hospitalization and take us away from the people who are actively dying Some of them will die because we cant devote all our resources to themWe have limited resources and theyre going to be spread even thinner very soonIm obligated to say that none of what Ive stated here should be taken as medical advice and your experience and risk may vary and talk to your own doctor please call dont go in person if you can avoid it I am not your doctor and I hope I wont be Listen to the World Health Organization recommendations  httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovelcoronavirus2019  Reduce the risk to yourself and the people youre in contact with however you safely canTake this seriously You are in danger The people you love are in danger Dont be stoic about this Be carefulAddendum I feel I need to add some disclaimers First I apologize but I cant answer most of the questions being asked Im not in a position to comment on social political or economic considerations The views I express here represent my own alone and not necessarily those of any other person group or institutionMost importantly not panicking is truly both necessary and appropriate Panic makes pretty much nothing better A level of healthy vigilance and reasonable precautions are appropriate Listen to the health authorities and take their advice definitely above my own Just be reasonable and be careful|0

Please call your doctor and mention how much fluid you are coughing up from your lungs That is a very serious issue regardless of what is causing the infection and you need to be evaluated by a medical professional|1
If you are claiming thisExposure to large amounts of air pollution might impact how severe respiratory symptoms areThen it would be better to say There s a link between the SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS and the pollution levlels  If i say There s a link between pollution and car accidents what would you  get from that That there s a higher risk of an accident or that pollution causes more severe accidents Bascially when i first read you title i get the impression  that the virus infection HAPPENS where there s pollution and thats not what you mean as far as i understandBtw  You are right pollution is a factor in determining both the mortality and the morbidity rates i am sure|0

I think there is selfish people in every ethnicityculturenationality and it is almost never right to generalize like that I also think that plenty Chinese showed how unselfish they are during this crisis Following your logic at what point do you think it is fair to criticize Americans as a whole This is the second American from the cruise ship that successfully evaded qurantine There was also another American trying to escape qurantine from the SoCal military base|0

Twitter has been useless Last week I spent a few hours flagging Russian bots who were spreading coronavirus disinformation They all said exactly the same thing and yet 2 days later the posts were still there with even more accounts all saying the same thing Youd think  they could at least use their algorithm to remove the accounts saying the same message Unfortunately when the real news is behind paywalls and is clearly not giving us the whole truth the lies will fill the vacuum Theyll let Donald Trump tell people that its a Democrat conspiracy but they wont let us share real information|0
I dont know but I feel happier that he isnt stupid enough to hand shake with a potential case or not to wear a mask and have meeting with some confirmed contact like eh some other presidents do|1
Lol The incompetence is unreal and they way they handled it its as if they want it to spread while saying its just a flu and will go away in April If you are putting any confidence in this administration you will be severely let down Thousands to millions could die bc of this inept competence and frankly lack of care Trump cutting the pandemic response team 2 years ago shouldve been your first clue that they are not looking out for the people|0

Theres a guy who has been in quarantine for 37 days now and is still testing positiveI know with the flu virus you can still be contagious up to 3 weeks after flu stop showing symptoms So between incubation time symptoms period and then after symptoms stopsomeone can possibly be contagious for a total of 6 weeks with the fluSo it only makes sense that coronavirus could be contagious for a long period of time in some individualsHowever it would be an exception to the norm rather than a precedent My concern is that scientists dont know yet if those who get coronavirus builds an immunity to itso its possible that you can keep getting it Again while the same can happen with the flu virusit is rare Hopefully this will be the same of COVID This period of uncertainty is the worst|0
Where are you going to stay if you get exposed I work in healthcare  At the current level of engineering once you have one sick patient chances are pretty high that you will have many sick staff eg the quarantine officer of the cruise ship  Do I go home to my family if I get possibly exposed at work  The most reasonable procedure would for me to selfisolate from my family until my institution is cleared from infection  Stay in a hotel|0
Even the head of the Chinese response team is saying that while effective chloroquine is not a miracle cure Its impressive theyve managed to find anything that works this early in the game But even if it works its doubtful that this is the beall and endall treatment for it For example until very recently everyone was talking about chloroquine now focus is switching to thisMy guess is if its efficacy is confirmed researchers will then isolate the mechanism and design a new drug that uses the same mechanism much more efficiently and perhaps along with other drugs that inhibit the virus by other mechanisms|1

the brain stem controls your breathing and instigates taking breaths when there is too much CO2 circulating in your blood and also some higher cortical areas make you panic if you didnt take a breath for a while making you gasp for air fentanyl  other opioids eg depress these neurons so there is a higher threshold of eg CO2 needed for the neurons to fire and make you react thats how they kill you the same is true for benzos  alcohol although they act on different receptors in the brain altough very very unlikely if you do not combine them|0

Because Indians do not piss on their open wounds any more than American whites bite peoples faces off while high on bath saltsDo some minority do it Yes But whats so difficult about point out that some minority do it to make whatever point you want to make Why dehumanize over a billion people with blatant BS Again Im not saying that some percentage of Indians do not do unhygienic things Im saying that most of them are rapidly educating and improving themselves and the ones Ive personally come across or observed are just normal human beingsI dont think its unreasonable for me to challenge someone saying India as a whole piss on open wounds I mean theres Indian immigrants everywhere in the US do you see them shitting on the streets or doing any of thatI really recommend people go watch videos of interviews conducted in India or whatever Itll help you view those people as actual humans rather than 4chan meme BS that make them sound like a bunch of wild animals|1
Alcoholbased hand sanitizers are your best bet if you cant get to soap and water you want to look for those made with at least 60 alcohol because these tend to be the most effective according to the CDC Check the label  ethyl alcohol ethanol isopropanol or npropanol are all fine to use Even some natural sanitizers are made with the correct percent of alcohol and are safe to useRemember its not just about what its made from but how you use it So make sure you read the instructions and cover all parts of your hands  between the fingers and under the nails are some of the spots people forgetNeha Pathak MD|1

my source is the Robert Koch Institut something akin to the CDC they issue a weekly report on Flu Cases but if the 14 hispitalization is based on the estiamtes of total Flu cases I found the difference because the 17 is based on CONFIRMED Influenza cases via lab testI couldnt fint any good estiamtes for total cases but the best i found 5 of total population get flu in a year about 15 of total cases need hospitalization sounds reasonable|0

I agree Canadas definitely not doing enough testingBut its test rate per million people is sadly approx average among various countries  As of the date of the article below March 11 Canada had tested almost 10x as many people proportionally than the UShttpswwwmacleanscanewscanadacouldcanadabeflatteningthecurveofcoronaviruscasesCanada had done almost as many tests as the US even though the US is approx 10x bigger And Canada hasnt done enough but it makes stark how little the US has doneAdding The reason for not testing everyone lately is apparently due to global shortage of the necessary swabs that are used in a testhttpswwwtheglobeandmailcomcanadaarticleontariolimitingcoronavirusteststothosewhohavesymptomsbut   Health officials in at least two provinces are limiting testing for COVID19 to prioritize the sickest patients or those who have not travelled outside of Canada but show symptoms in order to curb potential supply shortages The changes in Ontario and British Columbia are meant to conserve supplies and ensure the health system has the capacity to continue testing as the number of cases escalates potentially at a rapid pace Health officials say that for most people the recommendation to selfisolate after travelling even if they have show mild symptoms should be enoughThe countries that are hardest hit right now are probably getting priority from the swab manufacturers  But hopefully there will be more swabs soon We expect to return to expanded testing as soon as were confident in stable supply To do so were actively working with our manufacturing and supply chain partners to procure additional test kits Public Health Ontario said it is also looking into other swab types to increase testing|1

You know economic collapse caused by global pandemic hurts the economy right|0
This seems at odds with what were seeing elsewhere  Italy has thousands dead and the youngest is 39  Either that or young people who are far more likely to get infected are simply being treated very aggressively which may make sense if you have the resources|0

Thank you so much|1
Yes everyone knows people are going to die the point is that if you have a plan to instead of stalling the infection rate so the NHS can cope and instead of stalling the infection rate so that we can buy time for better treatments expansion of healthcare facilities and maybe a vaccine your plan is for 60 of the population to get it and that of everyone who gets it at least 10 need hospital and at least 1 die then you are actually saying youre preparing for more deaths than are necessary Especially becuase by not putting social distancing measures in place ASAP you are going to ensure the NHS is overburdenedIts just maths The NHS is going to be overburdened in a few weeks time with people who were infected in this past couple of weeks when the government did nothing to prevent them being infected And when the NHS is overburdened more people will start dying of other things as they are seeing in Italy Italy fucked up by not implementing measures soon enough We saw that happen to them we had the opportunity to do something differently but instead our government has just told us that many more people are going to die Not that theyre going to do their best to minimise loss of life just accept that people are going to die All other countries know and accept that too theyre not pretending no one will die theyre just taking the attitude of trying their best to minimise the loss of life by slowing infection rates and expanding capacity and buying time|0

Hey I feel the pain it just hit my county today Just remember the big picture this too shall pass Yes its going to be shitty for a few months or maybe a year but a very high percentage of people will be just fine Some people will die the economy is going to take a hit some places will be locked down for a period of time but for the most part people will continue through life as usual Try to avoid those subreddits I feel so much better forcing myself to stay away|0

My concern would more be that with FDM printers especially you get lots of little crevices between layers where bacterial can live which is why everyone over on r3Dprinting freaks out when people make parts that come in contact with food Id imagine the same concern applies here Granted given the situation that may be of lesser concern than the more immediate danger or not having the valves at all but Id imagine a 3D printed solution would still only be a stop gap measure It looks like the first ones made were FDM with another local company coming in with laser  powder system which may not have the same issues as FDM printing|1

No its not a crazy rule You guys go WAY beyond politics and frequently go into wishing death or serious illness upon people who have a little R next to their name Stop turning this into a partisan issue This has been mishandled by EVERY level of government by members of each party Some republicans got it right some democrats got it wrong Making it a hurr durr republicans bad issue is just pushing republicans away from taking it seriously Youre losing credibility by making it appear like an issue that is based on political shitflinging|0
Copy paste comment from rAnxietyThat leaked audio from Milan about how there were a ton of 20 year olds with severe pneumonia is a load of bsHaving said that the virologist in the trench of the Sack of Milan invites us to avoid psychosis we must say no to alarmism no to panic To throw the parents in terror was an audio file that spoke of intubated twentysomething Audio attributed to sanitary of the Niguarda of Milan which the same hospital vigorously denied last night A lie and unspeakable rubbish adds Professor Alberto Zangrillo head of San RaffaelehttpstwnewsititnewscoronavirusancheigiovaniinterapiaintensivanientepsicosimatuttirestinoacasahttpstwnewsititnewscoronavirusancheigiovaniinterapiaintensivanientepsicosimatuttirestinoacasaThere is one 18 year old in ICU but he added this to his commentWe have 27 people in intensive care six are cured and there is one of 18 But one It also happens in normal times that a young person can get pneumonia The average age of the patients is 70 years |0

I JUST got over the flu a couple weeks ago yet today I woke up with a sore throat yesterday but REALLY minor barely noticeable but I can tell its off I already came to terms with it possibly being Coronavirus since what are the chances I would get the same strain of flu I suppose it could be a minor cold but I rarely get those I went to sleep expecting to wake up with a fever or at least progressing in some way but nope same still Some people said allergies but Ive never had them before and I dont have any other symptomsIve been led to believe that if you DO have COVID19 the symptoms come hard and fast which is why we are seeing explosions in cases and subsequent death rates just like an aggressive flu But there have been cases where some people just feel a bit off and thats it Im 38 healthy and have always had a strong immune system so Im not too worried about myself but its frightening to think that I might be spreading COVID19 to others I work for myself so Im practically quarantined at work but I do fear for my wife and daughter since theres zero chance of containing it to myself at homeI would go get tested but weve already been told from a number of sources that you should only go to the hospital if you NEED to to ensure theres enough capacity for those that need more dire medical help Because besides for a very minor sore throat I feel tiptop|0

Look I dont mean to be a dick but considering youre an avid rthedonald poster I find it hard to believe you have a nuanced andor representative view of a state containing 40 million which is arguably the economic powerhouse of the nation or a country containing 330 million people You and people like you can hate California all you want but that doesnt mean most Americans share your opinion Id argue that outside of Trump supporters most people are sympathetic or at worst ambivalent to California I know for a fact the vast majority of Americans do not want people in California to die Its pretty sad that youve allowed politics to override basic human decency|0

Yes you may be more hygienic but the virus will spread anyway Maybe in the UK it is better and everyone is super thoughtful and 100 hygienic but here central Europe we still have people that dont give a shit go to work with colds use public transport cough without covering their mouths etc I mean most people dont even know that they should cough in their elbow And if people are not being 100 hygienic and thoughtful 247 then the virus will spread and our hygienic superiority wont help I am not saying we are not more hygienic it just is not enough Better is not enough we need perfect and I am afraid thats not possible|1

Yeah that data needs to be shared because officials are discounting itI saw an interview with the Australian Chief Medical Officer a couple of days ago some reporter asked about asymptotic transmission and he basically said that local Aussie experts dont think that is a real risk   I dont think he was lying or trying to reduce panic  To me it looked like he was  struggling to find a polite way to say yeah nah  That sounds like bullshit  Its not how it worksIf its real and Im starting to think it is based on the Hong Kong expert it wasnt communicated well at allI understand the disbelief   Its hard to imagine how China could be certain about this  It is hard to seeprove asymptotic transmission   Especially when you have an epidemic on your hands so there are multiple people who couldve transmitted the virus  The way it was communicated felt a bit like the true story might be we dont want to admit we missed tracingdiagnosing A so were going to say asymptotic B infected C   Definitely only 2 victims here no third unknown person  Weve got everything under control  It didnt have science vibes it had press release vibes|0

I also have an anxiety disorder so I can only imagine what youre feeling given the situation and your profession Youre in a very serious situation right now and your anxiety is justified so dont beat yourself up because youre experiencing it Id be more concerned if you werent anxious at all Also youre not alone in your feelings Im sure all of your colleagues and patients are also experiencing it some are just better at hiding it than others Dont feel like youre the only one panicking while everyone around you is being courageous Courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph over it Every day you go into work every patient you see every difficult decision you make those are all small triumphs and you need to give yourself credit for every one of them Remember that youre an expert and a professional That doesnt mean that the decisions you have to make will be easy or that youll always know what to do but it does mean that youre the most qualified to make those decisions so dont second guess yourself or beat yourself up about them The only bad decision is indecision followed by inaction Rely on your training and expertise when you can and when you cant just remember that nobody has trained for this exact scenario so everyone is going to be winging at some point and thats okayWhen you find yourself overwhelmed with anxiety try and pause for a moment to use your calming techniques It probably wont always be 100 effective thats normal and not a failing on your part Its not about controlling your anxiety its about not letting your anxiety control you No matter how things play out as long as you keep going youre winning If you do have a breakdown and cant keep going Ive been there too that doesnt make you a failure It does make you human and we all have our limits Youve just lost one battle with your disease and you need some time to regroup and tend to your wounds before youre ready to get back out there   One thing that really helps me when I start to freeze up with anxiety is to say what Im anxious about out loud I actually learned this trick from this cliphttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0q9o1YoPsA of Bill Hader and John Mulaney talking about their anxiety so maybe it will help you too|1

Mistake 1 Believing the CCPYou do not want to overrun the hospitals unless you are in dire need 8098 of cases do not need that kind of attention If I catch it Im locking myself in and staying put unless I actually need to be sent somewhereand even then Id rather die in my bed than in an overcrowded hospital|0

Basically the same shift happened in China In February people are wondering if other developed countries can handle the outbreak faster than CCP did Some say US can do a better job which is a hotly debated topic some we Chinese would always love to shit on US health care system xD Most people also believe that Japan or Europe can do a way better job given their streamlined healthcare managerial system And now people are really concerning the situation in Japan now The blaming of CCP has also been greatly reduced in the past 510 days Guess the Publicity Department of CCP was secretly thanking Japan and the US for saving their ass|1

This disgust you feel is completely irrational The rules of supply and demand work exactly the same when its about health and safety Its more important than ever during a crisis that goods are available which means that prices must be allowed to rise in response to the increased demand Stores often dont do this because of the resulting public illwill due to very few people having ever studied economics This is a market failure that leads to shortages since the quantity demanded greatly exceeds the quantity supplied Needed supplies sit in the basements of hoarders while people who really need them cant get themPeople who buy up the supplies of these underpriced goods and sell them for a profit are preventing hoarders from taking them and giving the opportunity for anyone who is willing to pay those higher prices to get them Those are the people we want to buy them because those are the people who will make the most use of them|0

It might sound like it but I am not going to try to defend any party since I dont have affiliation My countrys government is probably not giving a f eitherWhat must have been done thenYou cant apply quarantine measurements in everywhere all of a sudden for two reasons appeared to my mind now1 Economythis virtual scheme of bullshit economy is necessary it should be existing it should be working There are only few exceptions all arpund the world who might take the risk of stopping it China was one of them seemingly they succeeded They even built hospitals in matter of fucking days man What about others What can you do when your whole is in debt and need to keep this vicious circle of economy working2 Panic chaos and culture few weeks ago one redditor wrote something like this what if this started in USA In where nearly most of the population have private vehicles are extremely free are individualised even selfish are somehow hysterical and right to bear arms Could you imagine the chaos Chinese Japanese Korean these people are less likely to panic while they are more likely to obey every restriction and order compared to American folks I believe such panic and chaos would be more devastating for everyoneAlthough we are living in at the triumph of human history we are still animals Do not forget how ruthless and cruel we were in the times of black deathI also personally do not want to see many immigrants or refugees in my country especially asians nowadays because of this outbreak and I have right to demand this but this does not give me premission to be a racist or  ruthlesscruel person This is also why antiracist messages are published constantly this is part of further chaos believe it or notWhat could be done Suggestion  think there are few solutions and measurements that every country might consider and every citizen shall demand1 Protective masks for everyone if not free at reasonable prices Best measurement2 Warning messages and advertisements about healthcare and personal hygiene There are STILL a LOT of people who do not know ANYTHING about health and hygiene  Using masks properly washing hands not touching face before cleaning not getting in close with any stranger like kissing or hugging would greatly help everyone to decrease the risk of infection3 daily cleaning of transportation whicles and public places with at least alcohol4 testing every suspected case5 cooperation over establishing a network of productiondistribution of scientific information masks and potentially helpful drugs like remdesivir 6 Stockpiling medical supply7 IF they are really SMART HUMANITARIAN OR NATIONALISTIC ENOUGH they can provide a lot of funds for scientific researches and establish cooperation to create a vaccine immediately There are really bright people great facilities and companies However because they think that this virus is not going to be so destructive they wont do this BUT this is the right thing and ultimate solutionIn short you we everyone is right Governments are probably preparing or doing some of these They need votes in future I think nobody want their country to be devastatedNobody would want this virus to spread further unless they are psychopaths or extreme sociopaths But in this situation it is REALLY hard to control this completely And most of us are going to survive some of us wont even feel this virusBy the way I am a male and a smoker so I am pretty much under decent amount of risk but I worry about my family rather than myselfThanks for reading this if you did Best wishes|0

Google Translation Basically the kit can detect the virus in 20 minsAs the spread of Wuhan pneumonia is accelerating Sugentechs first bloodbased tuberculosis diagnostic kit has been confirmed that it can detect pneumonia in 20 minutes The accuracy of the diagnosis is also high since it is blood based If Sugentecs diagnostic kit is used it is possible to provide more effective protection by firsttime action based on accurate diagnosisAccording to Suzentec the company is currently conducting a largescale global onsite clinical trial in China and signed a clinical trial contract with Fudan University Medical School in Shanghai earlier this month Sugentec plans to enter into a contract with Chinese pharmaceutical company for the Chinese distributor of tuberculosis diagnostic kit and technology transferCurrent methods for diagnosing pneumonia include sputum deep phlegm near the lungs to test for the growth of the virus or ELISA tests for the presence of antibodies in the patients blood Both types of tests require sputum or blood to be extracted from the patient for a few days in a controlled testing facility making it difficult for the first responder to the patientThe most obvious way to diagnose viral infections is to examine the presence of viral genes by molecular diagnostics which takes time to develop molecular diagnostic reagents Even if reagents are developed the patients blood must be collected from the hospital and transferred to a laboratory equipped with an expensive largescale test facility for detailed examination The disadvantage is that it takes timeAs of today 27th Wuhan Pneumonia has reported 2840 confirmed patients in 30 Chinese provinces and 81 deaths In addition the spread of Wuhan pneumonia has spread worldwide with 8 confirmed Thai 5 US 5 Australian 4 Korean Japanese Singapore and Malaysia and 3 FrenchAs the number of patients increases rapidly the time required to obtain detailed test results in hospitals and existing inspection facilities is also expected to increase rapidlyConventional methods not only delay response through rapid patient classification but also test only in confined areas such as hospitals making it difficult to take precautionary measures to spread pneumonia through the movement of infected patients Thats why new fast and accurate diagnostics are neededA Sugentec official said Sutechtecs tuberculosis diagnostic kit diagnoses infection based on tuberculosisderived biomarkers In addition to determining tuberculosis susentecs tuberculosis diagnosis kit can be used to determine whether the patient is suspected of having pneumonia tuberculosis or a simple cold It takes about 20 minutes to get the test results so if there is a suspicious patient at the airport it is possible to immediately determine whether the infection is in the field and effective response is possibleHe added Unlike general medicines which are commercialized after phases 1 2 and 3 the diagnostic device requires only specialized laboratory tests and phase 1 clinical trials We are aiming to go beyond the markets in China and Europe to sell to international medical organizations and global markets such as WHOSuzentecs tuberculosis diagnostic kit has already been approved by Korea Food and Drug Administration and registered in health insurance and can be used in Korea He is currently discussing clinical licensing agreements and market entry with health authorities distributors and international medical organizations in many countries including China and Europe|1
Well something to keep in mind if you are sick with something else it is probably good that they didnt just send you the ER  You definitely dont want to pick it up at the hospital  I want to say you dont have it but that is nt something any of us are qualified forI would try to not ignore what your doctor said  I can imagine there are  a lot of people that are thinking they have Coronavirus right now and are flooding the doctors LOL   On the CDC website the symptoms appear to be cough fever and shortness of breath  If those are your symptomsI would definitely go to a doctor and try to get tested  But going to a doctors office is a huge risk in my opinion in itself|1

Out of curiosity I dont mean this in an accusatory way do you know your friends reasoning for being willing to chance going on the cruise Im legitimately curious about why people have been willing to risk nonessential travel especially on a cruise ship All Ive seen are speculative answers and havent heard any firsthand accounts Obviously I understand that no one wants to waste their money or their vacation but now theyll all have to spend at least two weeks in quarantine and a lot of them will have to contend with lost wages Did they not believe there was much of a risk|0
A slight increase of the number of cases but the number of deaths has dropped down Thats some good news|1

I had them on today gloves Got this weird look all day like Im some supervirus myself|1
Crazy to think of it If it was myself and my husband Id be ok job wise but Im not sure my husbands employer would be as understanding for an extended amount of time Wed lose our house if we couldnt pay our mortgage  Bills etc Im not sure many travel insurance policies would cover such a situation Or imagine we went alone and had someone mind our kids thinking wed be gone for 5 days max Id be devastated Thankfully I think cruise ships main demographic are retirees Although Ive seen families on twitter with kids trying to keep children entertained must be a nightmare All of this would actually turn me off ever going on a cruise|0
Its too late Everyone is going to catch this bug The only question remaining is how much we can control infection rates to avoid overcrowding our hospitals The more we spread infections out over time the more people we will saveBeyond that is not realistic to compare Italy to the US Italys population is less than 20 that of the US around 60M vs 327M Furthermore Italys land mass is just 3 of US land mass 116k square miles compared to 38M square miles The logistics of a full country wide quarantine between the two countries couldnt be more different I suspect it would impossible in the US without mobilizing the military for police action and I mean the whole of the military not just the National Guard As bad as COVID19 is Im not certain that its posse comitatus violating bad|0
Yeah Ive said this over and over again Id love to smack the look off that pretty boys face He doesnt understand the poor He does understand how to get votes though|1
My thoughts are similar However I would be remiss not to mention how much I loathe Doug Ford  I absolutely cannot stand him  But for today he showed up  He stood there in front of the microphone and looked gravely concerned  He was measured calm and showed just the right amount of concern that he looked like a leader for onceTrudeau has been doing all the right things  But I will say that there is a major issue when trying to shutdown the borders and close down all public spaces Information  I cant imagine suddenly declaring the borders closed and a mandatory lockdown and not having people panic riot and make decisions that are morally wrong  This is why theyve slowly implementing measures here and there without being sudden and unexpected  The toilet paper meme was a perfect example of why they Trudeau and the Premiers have been slowly escalating their response over the last month  If they had did this last month with a very small number of cases a lot of people would be pissed off  People need to have their mentality conditioned slowly and deliberately without suddenly creating panic or cognitive dissonance  Confusion can be very dangerous to the public and it wasnt worth the sudden escalation of a national emergency  Trudeaus very pointed suggestion for Canadians abroad to come home before it is too late was very important  Its a signal to get the fuck back home before they discontinue all flights and border crossings  This will happen soonAnd then theres the issue with America  Trump is a overgrown baby who needs to have his ego stroked  He cannot handle criticism and he certainly wont take to being told his country is unsafe  Trudeau has to be working on Trump via proxies and other ministers and no doubt American politicians and public servants are doing the same  This is not a very easy balancing act closing the borders has to be done with very grave consideration and timeSo for today kudos to both Trudeau and Ford  I hope they keep escalating their response to the pandemic by providing for laid off Canadians and closing down the borders with exception of cargo  goods|0
God I love that|1
Whats incorrect That in Australia at least acting with intent to cause the outcome and acting recklessly that is heedlessly of the outcome are not different I dont mean morally or commonly I mean as actual legal conceptsThats broadly the difference between for example manslaughter and murderOf course if I punched you in a fight and you died that is slightly different so it depends on the case all facts are different some punches can indeed be murder thoughSo youre telling me that the difference between intent and recklessness as legal terms  the meaning of those terms  is determined ad hoc by a trier of factIm confused|0

I get weirded out when I go to peoples houses who dont take off shoes Everyone has their shoes on so I just keep mine on too because I dont want to make it awkward It feels so weird and just not right My kids automatically take their shoes off going inside any house and I love them for that Trained them well Anytime anyone is in my house with shoes on I vacuum and mop like a mad person when they leave Thank God we have hardwoods I would die if people walked on carpet with shoes|1

Well at least youre understanding unlike some people that hospitals cant provide tests for everyone and the main focus is with people in actual risk groups Since the rest of us will very likely survive it the most important thing now is to keep the others from getting sick|0

The study I linked in a different comment came to the conclusion that there is a direct correlation between CFR and AQI in SARS4870 SARS cases occurred in these five regions which represented 914 of all cases in China The APIs of Guangdong Shanxi Hebei Beijing and Tianjin during April and May were 75 95 98 99 and 104 and the corresponding fatality were 384 536 558 766 and 8 respectively Data were fitted to the linear model case fatality  00630001API showing case fatality rates increased with the increment of APIAccording to my sources Daegu CFR 054 has an annual average of 66 AQIWuhan CFR 41 has an annual average of 102 AQIThere are definitely other factors at work and Wuhan is definitely a special case because the outbreak itself was different there But it might be a contributing factorMore numbersNanchang CFR 01 AQI Annual average 78Dongyang CFR 008 AQI Annual average 67Pingdingshan CFR 165 AQI Annual average 111Shaoyang Hunan Province CFR 039 AQI Annual average 92 possibly explainable by the infected not being in the city of Shaoyang its just the closest city I could find AQI statistics forHefei CFR 06 AQI Annual Average 82Shanghai CFR 089 AQI Annual Average 96I think we can at least see a trend there|0

I read a medical paper that said the antibodies likely have a half life of a few months So Boris wants herd immunity by getting a ton of people infected in a few weeks Thats not an entirely unreasonable strategy if they isolate every high risk person while that happens Not sure how itll play out in practice because there are unscientific reports from Italy and Holland that show 50 of ICU patients are under 60 so if I was in the UK I would likely isolate no matter what my risk factor and so herd strategy will fail|0

Thats crazy when you put it like that Man survived some seriously harsh times|0
Are they I thought quarantine was if you were potentially exposed and you waited 14 days to develop symptoms If you develop symptoms you remain isolated until asymptomatic Of course if it turns out that asymptomatic people are contagious we might be doing that wrong|0
Really appreciate that Yes thats my plan Its going to be tricky with a toddler home and my eldest preparing for his GCSEs It wasnt a choice I took lightly But these are unusual times We just have to do what we can and take each day at a time With little guidance from our government I think we need to follow our gut Id rather be over cautious than regret I didnt do more further down the line|1

I find it sadly ironic Trudeau has been claiming stopping flights is a knee jerk reaction His wife takes a completely unnecessary flight Contracts Covid19 and the likely spreads it to our PM during the worst crisis since WW2 Now our leader is locked in a bedroom when we need leadership most Maybe the bright side is he will actually wake up and take it serious that it affects him|0

At least some people here are thinking a step ahead Or thinking at all This isnt a sprint we have to get it right and throwing away 10s of years of science and modelling because the public want to feel better and are understandabley scared is not good leadership So glad the government here is using science and data rather than smashing the panic button and destroying lives in different waysThe UK strategy is the first Ive heard that addresses the reality one way or the other this will take lives but what we know about viruses suggests in the long term this method will take fewerAlso I never expected such transparency on what was bound to be a hard to swallow plan for many|0

We in the US basically had the most incompetent response imaginable I believed through most of January and February that the administrators at the CDC and NIH would be given free reign to do their jobs and that the engines of those two organizations were gearing up quietly in the background to hit the ground running at the first sign of trouble here Now we know they were deliberately set back by the White House It might be the most incompetent moment of governance in the history of this country Im honestly not sure what else even comes close|0

Correlation does mean they are relatedEithera this blood group causes more severe infectionsb more severe infections cause this blood typec this blood type and severe infections are both caused by an as yet unspecified variable What scientists call spurious d this blood type has a causal relationship with an as yet unspecified variable that in turn causes severe infections e Severe infections has a causal relationship with an as yet unspecified variable that in turn cases this blood typeYou may also be surprised to learn that in specifying our models we do all sorts of post hoc tests to see if the relationship is endogenous or if the model is misspecified in order to determine the causal relationship|0

Google Translated Two people from a Wuhan Chinese family who have flu symptoms have applied to the Ivalo Health Center last nightSamples were taken during Friday morning In the morning they are sent to Helsinki for analysis says infection chief Markku Broas at Lapland Central Hospital in Rovaniemi to Svenska YleA preliminary result clarifies during the afternoon or early evening says Mika Salminen department director at the Department of Health Safety at the Institute for Health and Welfare THL As a whole new type of virus is investigated the World Health Organization requires WHO to follow a certain protocol for verification This means that the test must be done several times before the result can be considered reliableSalminen still believes that the results will be ready by tomorrow Still about suspicionThe salmine emphasizes that it is still a suspicionWHO has issued instructions on what situations to test for the new corona virus and this suspicion meets the criteriaSalminen says that he does not know where the Chinese tourists who are sick are but that the authorities in Lapland hardly agree with it because it is about private individualsSalmin points out that it is the flu season around the world right now and the likelihood that the Chinese tourists would really have the corona virus is not that greatFinns need not worryAccording to infection chief Markku Broas there is no reason to panic because of the suspected casesSalminen says that it is perfectly normal to take samples of people who have lived in Wuhan and who have flu symptoms It is likely that some other normal disease is behind says Broas to STTBroas states that the two Chinese are in pretty good shapeOne has mild flu symptoms the other feels tired and a little sick he describes The family has come from Wuhan via NorwayThe Chinese family has been touring Lapland for a few days They have arrived from Wuhan in China via Norway says infection chief Markku BroasIt is in Wuhan that the new coronavirus epidemic has got its startSo far 26 people have died in the virus all deaths have occurred in China The countrys health authorities have confirmed nearly 830 infectedInfection cases have also been confirmed in South Korea Japan Hong Kong Macao Thailand Taiwan Singapore Vietnam and the United StatesOn Thursday the World Health Organization stated WHO it is still too early to announce an international emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak|0

Exactly I cant get the point why not even schools are getting closed for a while all over the country In my opinion this would be the simplest way to reduce the danger of infections on students when I was at school like 2 years ago the hygienics on the toilets for example theyve been horrible And most parents are still forcing their children to go to school even wa cold or symptomsI dont see any chances of reducing infections anymore sadly our Minister of Health Trottel Spahn fucked the whole situation up|0

The strange thing is that the baby is more dangerous to others as a carrier than as a human being sickened by COVID19 The young are almost untouched by the virus other than carrying the virus for a while with the capacity to infect others Symptoms for small children approach zero They had a fiveday old who caught it too and it didnt even faze the little oneSmall miracles that Its gotta be hard on the mom though If shes not positive herself its actually dangerous to hold her own child|0
Not only does the threat of a pandemic get downplayed the extent of the sickness is being downplayed Read an article yesterday where I think the guy was 21 He said he felt like he was going to die But just about anywhere else they make it sound like its easier than a regular cold Might not even notice the symptoms|0

It wasnt just a nursing home it was a nursing facility for people that need constant care This is a facility that sees a couple deaths per week on averageThe only subpopulation with worse health is palliative care patients|1
And it was that moment she realized she married a moron|0
As with a lot of things the wait makes it better |1
I wish I was there to cry my eyes out and clap too|0
1 China Makes all the stuff2 We dont3 China needs all the stuff for their own citizens 4 We dont get the stuff 5 China is the best place to be for COVID 19 They have all the stuff right there I mean where do you think these hospital beds breathing machines face masks and rubber gloves come from China You can be as antiChina as you want and they are still the most equipped|1
The lack of testing in Canada is disconcerting to me Like were at 64 case Theres no way I believe its that low|0
My God|1
Ive been doing that the whole time thank you very much|1
Daytona Beach NewsJournal OnlineHEALTH1144 AMCoronavirus Get the latest news and updates hereCoronavirus Sheriff Chitwood reveals 20 potential Volusia casesBy C A BridgescabridgesPosted at 205 AMUpdated at 1220 PM   On Friday night Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood released a list of 20 potential coronavirus cases in the county and the cities where theyre being monitoredAn educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free peopleThats how Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood began his Facebook post late Friday night when he revealed there are currently 20 potential coronavirus cases in the countyAnd on Saturday morning he said hell continue to provide the information as he receives it which is supposed to be twice a day from the Florida Department of HealthIf you dont put info out there you are creating a panic Chitwood said I know that they were adamant against anybody knowing what they were doing They didnt want people to know that we first responders were given that information I dont understand what the issue isTo date state and local authorities have only listed the number of people per county who have actually tested positive for the virus There were four in Volusia County as of 1 am Saturday|1
Praying hard enough will make the problems go away|0
New York is so densely packed with people its gotta be the worst place for a pandemic to hit|0
This is great that they are going to test more people but I worry the hospitals are going to end up looking like Wuhan and people who go because they have a cold are going to catch the virus when they wouldnt have before|1
Name and shame Take the whole machine to pieces Cad everythingGet everybody to replicate all  the parts  have them assembled privately and deliver them to all the hospitals clinic etc maybe free or a small fee1199 of cost Or even send the CAD files to every Chinese production site and have them sell for 499 LoL|1
I thought that too for a second  LOL  Thanks CoVid2019 for giving us a laugh|1
Unfortunately thats every society We can badmouth China about its treatment of certain poor classes of people What about the US Same Poor people are the pool of recruitment for soldiers and medical experiments And basically low wage slaves to the industry Its always like this and always will be like this The pretense they do it because they chose so for money is only that When the only means of survival is to make bad choices youll make them|0
To be fair to the American people the media cries wolf an awful lot|0
You are attacking the writer or the source but not the content The writer might be an idiot but even a broken clock is right twice a day Lets imagine this guy is a total idiot can you say something about his idea Here is his idea Johnsons strategy of letting the disease run through his country is clearly a disaster according to all studies they just published a couple specifically on this posted on rCOVID19 If you read the article it is also true that we never developed herd immunity for smallpox or measles Furthermore this is assuming that covid19 has no sequelae permanent damages in general which it has proven to have even in recovered patients especially in the lungs I dont need to remind you that the lungs are one of the few tissues in the body that do not regenerate unlike the liver for example I saw two speeches of Johnson and he clearly stated they wont try to contain it just mitigation Testing will be deprioritized If Johnson really believed his own madness he should self infect himself as soon as possible instead of running away from the virusFinally such a silly plan occurs naturally whenever all else fails anywaySo to suggest that this should be our plan A its like saying that you are not doing much about it and its like really hoping that this virus full of unknowns turns out to be benign in all the unknowns sequelae future mutations cross immunity in regards to future strains What the heck we do not even know how long immunity to the same strain lasts and we have 2 different strains circulation the ancestral type S and the new type L With no cross immunity since a German patient was infected with both Its like playing Russian roulette with a gun that you have found on the street without checking the barrel Because finding a way to check the barrel before seems too complicated and expensive So lets go back to plan A just shoot and hope for the best This cannot be a plan A Its always a plan B first you need to check the barrell somehow I honestly do not think that the UK people will let this happen|0
People are dumb as ducks sometimes|0
Once again out on sick leave would be a health condition If youre out on sick leave and they fire you that is in violation even in that will states because you are part of the protected class Sure they could fire you before you go on sick leave Then the joke would be on them if it never gets that point and they have no one to work for them|0
Yeah but he is also too dumb to understand probability Its only a matter of time before he eats a contaminated big mac|0
Maryland also did this and banned gatherings of 250 or more I work at a casino and still no word from them And of course employees still saying its no big deal Sigh|0
Yeah thats what Im saying In three months everyone in the service industry is going to get dumped on the street|0
Every country that installed 5g is getting symptoms Sweden was the first to implement it Then UK then Italy The first was China with the largest network of 100K 5g towers And they had the worst caseshttpsemfscientistorgThere is very little research on this technology and there are hundreds of scientists that are pleading for this technology to be reconsideredAfrica is the only country with no 5G towers and has virtually no cases of such illness|0
It is very serious Im not in any way denying it Thats why I was hoping this sub would be a good place to see some stories of precautions people were taking for example to inspire other people rather than give crappy advice|1
I disagree with the mask point As much it stop sick people from pushing stuff out it does the same for intake If it didnt work you wouldnt see medics doctors and nurses wearing themThe BC health unit is actually kinda dumb|0
People who have been previously confirmed positive and their situations have got worse Or new people who have just rocked up today|1
Thank you|1
 is a weird way to show this|0
Here in northern Germany some companies have sent their employees home for Kurtzarbeit You get 67 percent of the pay if you cannot work because of the coronavirus|0
Ive been using the same line to shut down the idiots Real innocent just ask do you remember anything like this happening beforeHas so far shut down 100 of idiots in my limited sampling|1
SARS traveled via fomites very effectively allowing it to quickly spread around a plane by way of the two crew members who spread the illness  The diagram on the right aligns with a more airbornebased illness which is likely how the CDC believes nCoV2019 spreads easiest|1
Its like an information video youd watch at school or work Its funny how different production is when they dont have to catch your attention like Western news|1
I remember the high horse Americans were on about how China was podunk and handling the situation Lol now look at us|1
Shutting the schools will also massively increase the transmission rates of the virus through children  Most of those children will end up being cared for by a carousel ride of friends relatives particularly retired ones and neighbors who will often be asked to look after more than one child  It would massively increase the number of people the children could spread the disease to and the number of people who could press the disease to children and would make social distancing for parents impossible unless they stopped working  Which would be fine if those parents worked in nonvital industries but most of our workforce isnt nonvital  And thats not just Medical workers drivers farmers  financial workers technicians and tradesmen thousands of office jobs in logistics and management etc are all vital to keeping food on the table and the clean water flowing  We cant afford for those people to have to stay home to care for children even if they do get sick pay|1
No word on it yet that I have heard Schoolsuniversities are set to be online classes only until end of March at the earliest I wouldnt expect word on other gatherings until around that time either|0
Lets just hope it doesnt have to be marked dumb on stone tablets by fire light|0
I just had this discussion with my fianc last night Im in the brittle asthmatic camp and find all this only the old and the sick guff that the media are spitting out to be abhorrent Its encouraging people who are youngfit and healthy behave in ways that could straight up kill more vulnerable people|0
The biggest issue is people being denied testing|0
Im a Canadian living in the US and Ive always thought it was disgusting that people here walk around their houses with outside shoes Glad there are finally Americans on the same page as me Now if anyone visits my house I wont hesitate to tell them to take off their damn shoes|0
Thank you Utah for doing the right thing and setting an example  Hopefully governor Waltz here in Minnesota is paying attention|1
Milan just warned the world today that 10 of cases end up in ICU This is still a big deal Additionally thats current cases Time from symptom onset to ARDS is 8 days|0
There is no spike in pneumonia related death at this point If the US has widespread COVID19 its not killing at the rate it is in ChinaI hesitate to share those conclusions Theres no reported spike in pneumoniarelated deaths at this point but the CDCs most weekly flu report as I see it correct me if theres a more up to date one only goes to samples collected February 8th Things can change dramatically in 12 daysSecondly given the rather substantial time from infection to onset to hospitalization to death if the US has widespread COVID19 it may indeed be killing at the same rate for patients at the same timepoint in the disease trajectoryThis is not to say I conclude there has been a spike or that COVID19 must be killing at the rate it is in China but rather I simply remain uncertain|0
I dont expect anything meaningful to happen The government are incompetent|0
I really do understand why this is getting the attention it needs Sorry if i worded that poorly My main gripe is i feel like swine flu was fucking terrible too obv not quite as aggressive But i feel like they really downplayed swine fluEdit the overwhelming is definitely terrifying|0
Anyone know how many have tested positive out of those 1500|1
In a year we will be able to look back and really see which countries have better health care at least for this disease I could see it going either way|1
In BC there are lots of people in rvancouver complaining of calling the 811 line and being told they cant get tested because they didnt meet the criteriaMaybe the other ones just showed up at a hospital which is not ideal|0
We need so much more of this Its so disturbing how many people arent treating this seriously enough despite all the shut downs|0
Can we get a 2020 edition remake of Contagion set on a cruise ship|0
Tom Hanks and his wife were tested in Australia because they were already there I think Idris Elba probably got tested in the UK The Utah Jazz did get the state provided tests instead of buying them privately so theres an example of some privilege|1
Showing that in two weeks infection levels will be 10k  I concur those are the forgives we will likely see|1
Doesnt matter No matter what China did the West had plenty of time to get ready and chose not to for the economy Lets fix our own countries first|1
Okay sure|1
By March 31st thats how many will need hospital care|1
Okay so 600 people go from serious to doing well and then 200 go from critical to only serious and then less people die cause they found a Cure|0
Iran has trouble finding and identifying infected patients Likely they also didnt or dont inform their people properly what to doavoid contact washing hands etc So likely the virus is very widespread and only severe cases are found and tested I could be wrong here but in my opinion middle eastern people have far more close contactkissinghugging with other people then Europeans for example which also increases infectivity|0
They are doing nothing European Comission in a meeting today said countries should not do any rash moves and not to institute border controls|1
Who cares about that WILDERNESS|1
This is happening at lots of places in the US People stepping up like true ballers to help out their elderly and infirm neighbors   Lots of FB activity in my neck of the woods with people printing off notices and lists for others to leave on doors with contact information A LOT of local restaurants are offering specials or even making donations of food to MealsonWheels programs and organized deliveries for kids on freeorreducedpay school lunch programs that are suddenly cut off now that the state has closed all the public elementary middle and high schools   A fair number of people not being utter and complete dicks|1
My super tight wing neighbor is losing his fucking mind over the prospect|1
 Wests turn people are suddenly in a state of panic hope their government offered the same level of managementyou could do similar level of viral defence without totally destroying any shred of freedom of press nor with welding people in homes with no real means to take care of themselves I think big part of critique was about how they applied given level of isolation on human level|1
I have met members of parliament When I ask them a question they ramble on and on and dont respond to the question mostly because they come from wealthy lifestyles and are completely detached from the realities of how the average joe lives their life They are completely out of touch and clueless and they only care about themselves Which lines up with what youre saying How is this conjuring up a bogey man|1
They dont want people to reaction vote for free hc after they realise nobody can afford to be tested and that America is fucked as far as coronavirus is concerned because of that|0
Maybe some of us willcome out better people in the end |1
Peace between worlds|1
what types of drugs would be best to stock up on|1
Yeah It was gross I dont think Ill ever forget it|0
Just pump another 15 trillion into the stock market duh Im no matheconomist but that should feed people for at least 6 months right|0
When I went to see the the doctor last week my doctor asked me if I have been to China and laughed Then she said I have tonsillitis My tonsils dont even hurt Its all in my chest and lungs At least where I am at they think the Coronavirus is literally a joke|1
Thats why I said normally its healthy thats all I said  Did I state anything beyond that|1
Yes they should have them|1
So you work with immigrants and generalized all of their opinions because of that Your evidence is anecdotal and hilariously racist It is either for obvious political reasons or he is truly as dumb as he looks|0
Thats why having everyone wearing masks save lives They dramatically lowers the likelihood of infection by asymptomatic people|1
That is a good option for me however please be kind to others in the queues And whilst you are there please donate to your local foodbank if you can We are keeping the services running|1
They absolutely will  They will not be given a test if they are asymptomatic  This pleases me|1
thanks the doubling rate is close to each 3 days recently original outbreak in wuhan made 35 days|1
I need want coffee booze and well food is actually a need  But im not going to starbucks or any coffee shop Im making it at home  For booze I bought a few cases of wine and might go to a store for beer next week if wearing a mask and minimizing exposure  My point is we can get the things we want need with minimal risk to ourselves and others|1
He wouldve been better off leaving out the first part and instead focusing on the PPE shortage|1
We all know people like him Im pretty sure there was more he was doing that the cameras didnt catch If hes gonna make these jokes out in public like that then theres a good chance he was cutting up just to be edgy out in personHe basically went out of his way to get infected|1
I might be a natural genius at science because I had a smart uncle|1
I did The virus is gonna come to my house eventually but I dont gotta run out to the street to greet it|1
Nope Theres no excuses to be out frolicking if youve tested positive None|1
Yes when PPE runs out all medical people should go home let people suffer and die That way more Canadians might wake up to the ridiculousness of this country including how little sense of duty or obligation we feel to our fellow countrymen let alone fellow human beings  despite the incessant virtue signalling on social media about how woke and caring we all areAs horrific as the situation is if I were a medical professional so long as I didnt have a serious underlying health condition Id stick it out and do what I could to help  but I guess that way of thinking is no longer in fashion|0
Excellent graph thanks for making this|1
This puts it at 250k per year in the UShttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed25887770 Luckily the mortality rate is something like 6 per 100kx200BIf you need a copy of the study PM me and well set something up|1

I guess you cant My parents age 57 just returned home from a 2 month trip with my dogs their dogs but basically my dogs that went with them and I cant go an see them right now just in case Im pretty fit and young enough were I would likely experience minimal symptoms so there is no telling without a testIts also allergy season or at least in my area the bloom just hit so it could even just be that|1
Dumbasses like this is whats making this whole mess worse For god sake maybe we do need extinction This isnt the first idiot that pulls a stunt like this Theres this married old couple that lied to get off from the cruise quarantine|1
Its not that its more like hey its cheaper to pay wages there lets go and get some cheap labor and make money|1
Translation from me In 1988 Italy donated the largest hospital to date in Sichuan 30 years later this hospital is still serving a large role in providing medical aid to the region More importantly I remember in 08 after the big WenChuan earthquake Italys Red Cross and associated medical services sent 14 expert staff to embed in the hard hit mianyang sp region They worked for a long time leading a team of 900 local emergency workers in the road to recovery As a result of these actions the people of Sichuan have always felt a sense of appreciation for Italians an so in this time of disaster there must be a repayment|0
My gf went to see a nurse today were in France and his mentality is still more people died of the flu European countries are fucked In the ass with a rusty rebar|0
True|1
Oh I connected your comment to the general topic not to what you were actually replying to My bad|0
Thanks for being so thoughtfully generous in such difficult times Heres warm thoughts for you and your mother|1
Nice|1
 Theres not going to be panic if the information is given to the public directly and honestlyYou are IMO overestimating the publics capability for rational thought People are already seriously asking if they have 2019nCoV on social media combine that with a seasonal flu spike and you have hundreds to thousands of people potentially thinking that they need testing for it if you DO have anyone infected with a spike in hospital attendance you have the perfect mechanism for increased transmissionI will say this again At present there are very few people infected outside of China until we see obvious spikes of H2H transmission in countries outside China the safest assumption is that it is the flu and people should take the actions and precautions that they normally wouldAt no point have I suggested that people dont take action to prevent transmission what I have done is acknowledge that a great many people simply cannot afford to do so That is shameful inofitself|0
Can we stop upvoting shit like thisThe antiChina hivemind ist way worse than the China supporters which I have never seen in Threads like this largescale at all Its mostly just people reasoning that not everything is a fucking setup and then overreactive idiots calling them goonsNo one here is denying the Chinese government is a totalitarian regime or tries to be But you people need to seriously stop this shit|0
But we have the same problem here People with less severe symptoms are told to go home those with mild symptoms that dont go to the doctor will continue spreading it around|0
The public officials in BC keep saying low risk So I doubt businesses will care much|0
Thats the catch22 the local government doesnt seem to comprehend  but theres nothing I can do about getting tested unless Im dying from pneumonia as an individualAll I can do is  protect myself as best as I can and protect others by wearing a mask as I think everyone should when they are sick|1
I think so too Unfortunately we are close enough to Louisville for this to most likely affect us very soon She doesnt have a long time to figure it out so I hope the library board votes it or the state or county force is to close|1
I havent discussed it with anyone outside of my immediate circle  I do like to just keep an eye on the general consensus though It seems odd all these people taking the piss yet even our shops are void of toilet paper We dont have any confirmed cases in our area yet And people are absolutely in denial that anything could happen on our little isle|0
Piss|0
While it does feel like a very large amount for what we are hearing totals are from China and the rest of the world it honestly isnt773k masks a day held steady would still take 24 years to make enough for 7 billion people on the planet Now not all 7 billion people hopefully will need a test but several of those people are likely taking the test more than once  1 year at that rate of production would equal 282145000 tests  At current rate of numbers we are being told nevermind possible unkowns we arent hearing  we just might need those and more|1
Keep in mind this article uses significant in the scientific sense Clinically the effect is fairly small|1
talk to the media about this seriously|0
Arguably people with jobs spend less time deep diving current events on the internet Unless they are in ITTech haha|1
Science has become politicized and when something becomes politicized it becomes corrupt Science is corrupt People are right to be skeptical of corrupt enterprisesThat said when theres overwhelming evidence of the severity of an outbreak as theres been for this coronavirus for two months now the time for skepticism is over Its now time to plan and prepared|0
Xi needs to worry about reelection but from people in the party overthrowing him instead of the general public|1
Sadly the numbers just keep increasing as long as thats the case the worst is yet to come|0
Only 5000 dead When that number explodes exponentially they will wake up|0
Electronics dont work like other products The margins in an iPhone are absolutely absurd My margins are around 16 Theirs are 60|0
Not dying yet Its too early to tell if it will kill children at the same rate as adults considering chinas numbers are total horseshit and its only exploded internationally in the past two weeks while it can take around a month for healthy people to die of the infection|0
Its just a really odd statement to make I work in making predicitive models for a financial services company A simple way youd make a GLM is to fit a polynomial curve against a factor in the case of the virus that factor could be time The problem here is in not making it too predictive It sounds counter intuitive but this type of overfitting is the biggest problem in predictive modelling well after crap data But if i have an equation of x  x2  x3  x4   then all I need is enough terms and I can make it fit pretty much anything And an equation with x up to 10 is still a very sinple equationBut it has no predicitve power Once those powers get high enough I am no longer fitting the trend Im just fitting the noise This is why GBMs as an array of weak formulas are winning all the kaggle comps as they are able to get the trend without the noise But their fit scores will be poor because their power is in not overfitting to the dataall is an exaggeration for effect |0
the thing literally affects animals i dont think it gives a shit about what race you are|0
Saw a very well qualified care worker today Asked him about the virus Got Its just the fluI can only hope they have been told to say this to reduce panic|1
Oh just wait The growth is exponential This is like barely cracking oandoras box before shit gets thrown wide openSpain is about to get fucked too with their festivals etcAmerica is still worse off Our Healthcare system is literally built to make a mass grave if something like this hits Which it has|0

What it looks like in Tokyo now imgur linkhttpsimgurcomaKTUA8Qk Im not 100 sure if the pic is a recent one but I talked to someone who lives in Tokyo and she said almost everyone is wearing a mask now  If the governments numbers are true Japan is not experiencing exponential growth though the first case was found early on  Masks could be the reason why|1
Um no so even more ironic then|0
We tried to order gloves this week at work hospice and they are backordered Sowe have some for now but IDK for how long|0
I suggested this to my husband just last night Weve got a perfectly good mall on life support just a few miles from here A few small spaces are still rented but the former department stores would give a lot of space for beds Our issue here is that its a ruralish area and we dont have spare healthcare workers|1
Hello and good luck from Shenzhen |1
 Arent we taking more measures than we took during the SARS epidemic This is a rather broad question In an absolute sense yes but not relative to the threat The tools we have from Molecular Biology to databases and smartphones tracking GPS 200 DNA sequencing even people discussing this online I dont think we know how we will do against this threat if properly mobilized All the experts seems to be conceding already Communist governments are not adaptive there is no free speech nor is there a free market academics are under state control and controlling the narrative is everything It works for controlling people though and this is often enough None of their tools work for a virus If party members are given passage out of quarantine the virus will follow If a local bureaucrat reports zero new cases the virus will expose him If you shut down a whistle blowers the virus will vindicate them In countries where there are free people where we make fun of our politicians and officials as a matter of course problems can be solved if we are properly motivated And what is going on in China is probably enough motivation|1
I was just thinking about that Why are some people admitting that there probably are a bunch of un detected cases but still believe the fatality rate Makes no sense The only real rates we have are based of of false data|0
When people are frightened and prepare they tend to do so quite reasonably Yes there is going to be a run on hand sanitizer but frightened people are much more useful in an emergency  People will buy the items that they think will help them from the supply available Panic in this case is preparing as possible then taking sensible precautions The panic will hurt the economy not the population directly That is what is being coddled right now at the cost of citizens lives|0
Im really sorry This crisis is affecting lots of different people in lots of different ways Some people think that we can only be sorry for the ones that are most hurt but I disagree I hope the best of luck for you and your business when this whole thing is over I hope you thrive|1
 who is to say someone wont hold medical staff at gunpoint unless they comply with their demands to continue treatment on their loved ones even though another patient may be benefitted more with less resources being used There is minimal security at many hospitals  European here Were also fucked overhere but this this did not passed by my mind so far I never considered USAs situation from this perspective and now that you mention it i cannot not imagine a single hospital over there will not have to face maniacs with guns|0
Yeah Connecting with kind strangers feels like a vital medicine right now  Im glad you made a decision that felt right to you about keeping your kids homealthough I imagine that cant be easy either depending on their ages Maybe theyre tearing around the house or maybe theyre older and just glued to their phones Im glad that one of the colleges I teach at is starting break after next weeks finals and my teaching obligations are done there since my course doesnt have a final but my other college where I work fulltime is still scheduled to return from break on Monday Im hoping something changes and that doesnt happen Granted I was planning to leave that job end of the year lol life is never simple eh so maybe Ill just give them an ultimatum like Fire me for refusing to hold inperson class if you want but then these students wont have a teacher On the other hand if you let me teach online class can continue Im out of here at the end of the term either way so reprimands have no effectI really feel for studentsyoung people at this time Despite our best attempts to continue classes online the quality of education will suffer Students will be distracted or scared Some may not have access to a computer I hope colleges give everyone a wave of the hand and award creditsdegrees anyway because no one will have timeresources to repeat any of this Thank you for the information about the viruses on surfaces I havent been able to find any face masks but I did find this article online about making reusable fabric face masks with disposable filters I have a sewing machine so I think Ill get crafty today httpsmustsharenewscomclothfacemask  Up until a few days ago the discourse surrounding masks was that they didnt help but now more information is coming to light that they do whether were sick or healthy Maybe youve heard the same|0

If you want to demand something demand the government subsidize coronavirus tests and treatments specifically and put a moratorium on charges for people who are infected andor for areas that need to shut down to contain the spreadUBI and medicare for all right now is just pure and utter insanity All shes doing is pandering to her twitter followers instead of trying to actually fix anything because you know its fucking impossible If the government did try to do something like that the country would just collapse|0
No shit Im not  Did I sound like one Does that even matter If I was making a conjecture it would But Im simply attempting poorly I will admit to parrot someone who IS a scientist  When I have time I will find the source or you can google it yourself I actually saw it on Reddit the other day but I dont think I saved it|0
Its a good point Spanish Flu or Bird Flu maybe if we have that sort of data Im not sure weve ever experienced anything that compares easily|0

Trolls have infiltrated this thread and many others in the last two days I hope mods ban them They know who they are They are not productive and dangerous given the severity of the situation|1
Thats great news This means the death percentage is much much less than reported Looks like its not as deadly as reported|1
That is wild Last I heard cruise lines were not giving any refunds in light of this situation seems downright criminalThat said I recognize that this might be the end of the cruise industry and I sympathize for everyone who will lose their jobs|0
I figured that was the motivation behind bailing out Greece and accepting millions of refugees when the rest of the EU was against it|1
How would that work in the US Legit question If you cant afford healthcare and you are contagious can you simply refuse care or will the state cover it in order to prevent an outbreak|0
But you say hes just a friend|1
In retail yes But the government still has them right|1
Maybe the Spiegel report included hospital numbers then I guess Its a bit of a shame that its so difficult to get stats on this in Germany due to the way its structured but I guess they have better things to do than compile stats at the moment|1
Far more I think According to a study done in Italy 50 to 75 are asymptomatic meaning they are not even sick The good news of course is that the mortality rate is lower however if you take that into account there could be easily 10k cases 20 days ago assuming 1|1
Because not debating it and rushing into something is irrational maybeThis isnt black or white my way vs your way  But thats my point There should be some effort being put into minimizing the overburdening of hospitals AND not financially crippling people|0

Yup the hospital iso ward is not a clean room You being at home alone is better isolation than a hospital|0
Only if you take that number to heart and ignore all circumstances The two people who died first were elderly which are the group most affected by the virus and most likely to die Having endured the loss of two parents and being shunned from hospitals along with likely having very little to no help in dealing with the virus its not particularly extraordinary to think of the man who wrote this letter dying The wife is okay currently though I cant imagine the sheer mental anguish shes going through|0

In a few weeks with this governments starts to finally get it shit together and administer test right we are gonna be shocked at how many mild and asymptomatic cases there are I may be young and naive but im deeply hurt that my country would treat me like this|0
Who is we What country do you think everyone reading this is in What a weird way to think on a global forum|0
Its going to be quiet The hospitals will be overrunning like triage centers bot associated with modern cities Let things are going to be extremely difficult to do Maybe not the best way to say it|0
No I totally agree with you it is a problem not everyone can get masks and you dont want hoarders You also dont want vulnerable people not buying masks because they cant afford it But here is another problem If demand outstrips supply and vendors are not allowed to raise prices you will see vendors sell out immediately and on top of that profiteers will try to capitalize on the mismatch by hoarding masks and selling them at the market price So what you have in the situation where raising prices is not allowed is masks selling out and people who need masks still not getting them Price gouging ensures that there is a supply for people who need the masks the most and vendors will be extremely incentivized to get more supply extremely quickly Its not pretty I know This is where government needs to come in and distribute masks quickly But if you dont allow price gouging people WILL hoard masks and you will have people who really need them not able to get them|0
I was just scrolling through Facebook and saw my place of work posting something about were using precautions of wiping things down and training our staff with a picture of hand sanitizer and wipes We have a lot of elderly guests as well and this just really killed my mood|0
A shut down is needed in order to do this I do think we will be fine though we just have to do a bit more right now in order to flatten|1
His voice sounded like he was sick last night during the speech I think if he already has it they wont tell the public that would be suicide for his upcoming campaign Since he is telling everyone 1 person is sick maybe 5 by next month He is delusional at best and keeps shaking hands with random supporters|0
I saw two schools of thought on this1 Running marathons actually takes a rough toll on your body so marathon runners may not be as healthy as they appear2 He may have run a marathon after contracting the virus I never checked to confirm this which could have spread the virus and caused strain on his bodyrespiratory systemI am not a doctor and do not know if these are reasonable deductions Im just restating some of the justifications I saw in the initial thread|0
Its like they know this is much worse than theyre letting on|0
  is start testing asymptomatic peoplethere are not enough resources and kits to test the sick Healthy people have next to zero chance being tested now|1

No I think school buses are an American thing I didnt even realise they were real until after watching the Dark Knight Dont think they happen in Europe eitherWhats extra stupid is that our Autumn Fall hoildays are gonna start after like 1 or 2 weeks anyways Why the fuck are we not just moving those holidays up to right now Makes no fucking sense|0
I can attest to that on behalf of myself lol|1
its like that scene from parasite|1
I dont think theres a clear answer at least not yetThe right kind of mask used correctly in conjunction with the other proper hygiene measures will offer protectionHowever when public health groups make recommendations theyre also factoring psychological reactions to their recommendation Will people use the right masks Will they take care to use them correctly Will the mask give them a false sense of security that leads them to not take more effective protective measures Will people hoard resources and if so what affect will that have on the people that really need the masks In a western society where regular mask wearing is uncommon will the sight of masks everywhere induce panic What knock on effects could a panic haveTo me both recommendations are totally justifiable It comes down to how you evaluate different risksbenefits We probably wont know for months or even years which was more effective and why For all the bad about this outbreak its also providing a huge opportunity for public health data gathering that we will be analyzing and deploying in the years ahead|0
Yeah thats fine when you dont have an overwhelmed healthcare system|1
Human nature man You can try to stop it and theyll go underground Itll take decades to get it out of the generational cycles Im not advocating for their weird shit they eat but lets be realistic Youre just being idealistic which does nothing except virtue signal ThanksYou dont get it whats your solution Go kill them all|0

Median timetodeath is 20 days By most accounts it seems to be the 2nd week of symptoms that decides whether you will worsen to critical by 3rd week or begin to recover Part of the issue with overwhelmed healthcare systems is the sheer amount of time it takes to run through the course of this disease and how long a serious patient takes a bed|0

Isolate yourself People are being selfish for having grocery stores open and any place of work Medical should be for important things|0
Looks great but I think there may be a small typo in the narrative I think it should say to reduce transmission TO instead of BY This confused me|0
I cant help thinking this ongoing disaster was partially forged by the trollsI felt that for years of the smear towards China majority of people online tend to believe China as a poordirty place that the CCP regime has no interests in protecting its citizen what so ever so when the virus showed up in Wuhan a city with decent medical resources people tend to think of course there will be an outbreak in that filthy place when Wuhan got locked down instead of thinking shit this virus is for real they tend to think ah typical CCP stuff to prison its citizens then the data China shared no matter how detailed are naturally get criticized and people tend to believe of course these data are all fakeall combined we saw a world that most nations just wasted that past best 12 months to protect them from the pandemic spreadingI never thought online trolling can cause so many deaths around the world|0

I am in New Orleans and have symptoms and asthma Its getting harder to breathe If I miss work I could get fired and I dont get paid sick days either I also dont have insurance to go to the doctor Any info on what I should do I want to get tested but I am sure the test isnt here yet I dont want to just waltz into any old urgent care or hospital and spread it to healthcare workers and people with underlying conditions|1

I think it could still be effective  Police and volunteers deputized could patrol  Certainly something could be put in place so people can stay home for a period of time without losing their jobs if a certain threshold is met within a geographic area|1
Huh Slashing the budget firing the global security team letting 700 positions at the CDC is not enough How about Trump blaming the stock market crash on the Democrats refusal to take the crisis seriously a clear marker that he wants to minimize any bad news about Coronavirus and putting Pence in charge Pence oversaw an serious outbreak  of HIV in Indiana and refused to do anything about it despite pleading from those Republicans involved Pence does not accept Evolution so how can he reasonably handle this|0
Same at my workplace basically you can use your 3 paid sick days we get a year if you even have any left then youre on your own unpaid time off   unless you can use vacation days or even have them so great ppl who cant afford to stay home when they feel off will be in because what other choice do they have|1
 youd be broke|0
Thats why everyone should practice social distancing and vigilant hygiene at all times whether youre sick or not|0
That part of Italy has some of the worst air quality in Europe PM levels consistently high all year round and last year they hit their yearly safe exposure limit at the end of February So if that marathon runner was outside doing lots of running for years on end breathing in shitty air then this would expose them to lots of fine particulate matterThe 3 worst hit places on this planet are all places with horrifically bad air quality meanwhile its apparently been going around Seattle for months now and only reared its head when it hit an old folks home Seattle has relatively low PM levels all year round|0
Australia is lucky geographically but its one of the most common destinations for people travelling from north eastern Asian countries We left our borders open with lip service levels of testing and were about to pay the price for it The worst outbreaks so far are occurring in Sydney suburban areas that are high in people from those same north eastern Asian countries No surprise at all|0

Isnt Los Alamos rumored to be Area 51 research Or just generally top secret defense research|1
Its crazy that they just quarantine the travelers who test positive when they know it transmits h2h to potentially all the contacts these people had before quarantine We have the same situation in Norway people are stealing disinfectant from doctors office waiting rooms and hospitals are running out of surgical masks The general population are all saying its only dangerous to the old and sick do idgaf People are leaving quarantine and going to gyms and stores Im waiting for Oslo to become Wuhan 2|0
Yeah Must be that The bar is too low Since Trump election I miss George W Bush Probably the same syndrome I used to hate the guy from all my guts|0
Thats 3 months without YouTube Now thats millennial cruelty lol|0
Confirmed A month and a half ago nobody was testing for this virus because they wouldnt have known what to look forChina is having to catch up to numbers of already infected with majority of confirmed and critical cases having already been infected weeks agoIntuitively I think HK estimates for Wuhan are correct and something like 45k had already been infected and symptomatic  and then you have about 12k that are in serious  critical condition|0
At double the pay|0
Hey thats what happens when the young generation are treated like shit forced to take appalling qualifications GCSEs and A levels are a joke and then pay 30k at least for a dogshit degree that even then doesnt guarantee a good job NGL I wont complain if a few thousand elderly die This country is broke already|0

AccidentDeliberate would imply they already have a vaccineHeres the deal  They shut Wuhan down  Quarantined millionsIf theres no vaccine eventually EVERY large city in China will go through the same thing Wuhan did  Even if their quarantines worked perfectly with no leakage  because someone would eventually fly in from Iran or Italy or wherever and start the whole epidemic over again  A single asymptomatic person false negative would be all it takes Even quarantining all visitors might not prevent it Just as a single burning ember can restart a wildfireIf suddenly miraculously the virus stops at Wuhan city limits AND we start getting reports about mass immunizations in ChinaThen its time to roll out the ICBMs|0

There werent nearly as much pent up controversies across the nation as it is now and the digital communication channels werent as developed as todays areMore people are aware and more people are disappointed plus frustratedNot to speak of that the regime never really learned their lesson from the previous pandemic despite it happened in less than 20 years ago|0

 I feel your pain dont have any suggestions I work in a grocery store been doing 6 days straight for the last month but the last few days have been real Seeing the madness and the lack of hin people and the lack of hygiene among customers is scary The people who do cover their mouths when coughing use their hands People not understanding why toilet paper isnt on the shelf and not understanding why I cant put away packs for them when they come in and becoming angry I joke around with my coworkers try to remain calm but when I get home I get scared I am not a hero just a scared dude trying to keep the lights on and a roof over my head Stay strong enjoy your time with your loved ones Watch your favourite tv showmovie go for a walk if you can find a place thats has few people Make your girlfriend breakfast in bed|0
I see what you are saying but this paper is an older age cohort Lets just say you locked up 50 and let under 50 run wild you will still run out of beds and mortality will be higher than it otherwise It seems like there is a bigger gap between hospitalization and mortality at the younger ages  meaning they can be saved|1
You say you dont agree and then you point out that it would have stung a little less coming from Biden I mean Romney was praised for itIts literally only because hes a black man PPACA isnt even required and they still want to gut it|1
Yes i see that with my work We are working day long with gloves We work with really oily material So very dry hand And its really easy to be cut with these shit alu thing I cant use cotton gloves under Ive already trouble putting the XL ones  the fact that im the only one tooking covid19 seriously there|1
dude is like 4 foot 10 lol also hes old so he probably wont survive once he gets infected thats unfortunate because he seems pretty based|1

According to scmphttpswwwscmpcomnewschinasocietyarticle3074032progressagainstcoronaviruschinanewcaseswaneepidemichotwe are hopeful that in April some of the vaccines that are being developed will enter clinical research or they would be of use in emergency situationsUnder national regulations vaccines developed for major public health emergencies can be deployed for urgent use under specified conditionsDoes similar regulation exists in Italy or the US that would fast track deployment of experimental vaccine for select population if the epidemic continues to worsen|0
Haha arent you a super man Its a strange world where for all of its obvious biases and botting Reddit still provides better indepth knowledge than any other traditional resource And most of the online ones|1
mortality rate is low if you get treatment 20 have complications the problem is once the hospitals are out of order mortality rates will rise sharply This 23 is also complete nonsense They just keep dividing sickdead Not so simple considering you are sick for 6 weeks8 weeks Mortality rate can be determined only after all that have been sick are no longer sick|0
yall i really thought this would break his ego i cant believe i was foolish enough to think this but i really thought he would finally get the message and inspire us to rally togetherbut holy shit hes trying to take credit for the travel ban yes fine that was a good move but that was 2 months ago and trying to put the blame on europeare you serioustake no blame deny deny deny we are doing great we have so few cases because no one could get tested|0
They should start shutting down schools now Especially elementary schools with kids at riskThose places are like incubators and this will only get worse Kids at school are already regular sickIm just worried how manyIf any have the virus already|0
Are you a virologist or an expert in epidemicsIve seen many doctors who have also studied medicine say Its just a flu broBeing a doctor doesnt give you immediate knowledge of an epidemic especially since we barely know anything about this Covid19 You are using the fallacy of authority if I recall basically saying that I have this or I am this therefore I am right in what I say without explaining what proof do you have of what you sayIf we judge by the statistics this is not a death sentence for the elderly Only a 16 of chances of dying for those elder than 80 which is a lot but not a death sentence Recovery can be made Not all is dark this is good news|1
if youre in the united states they are not testing for it|1
Thats what I truly dont comprehend The better your response is the better both the short and long term outlooks areThe only benefit to fucking it up this bad is the myopically short term outlook days might be a hair better until the bottom falls out|0

Interested in this too|1
This Im trying to convince my boss to allow me to teleworking but they want us all in the Office Just sitting around infecting each other I guess|1
Theres been some news recently regarding two different virus strains LCoV and SCoV Can we confidently say that this is the case currently Do epidemiological studies support this If so what are the implicationsAlso would we need to produce a vaccine for both or would one vaccine be sufficientThank for taking questions|1
lol you magnificient beast I forgot about that event ty for reminding me of that|1
people in the US especially the midwest are used to getting a cold or cough in the winter and toughing it out they think nothing of it and assume other people will just deal with it too its annoying as fuckright now there arent many cases in the US to cause people to really reconsider this but if that changes i do think a lot of people would actually stay home assuming their work allows them to this isnt just a cough you can tough out it poses real risks to anyone over like 55 and all it takes is something as simple as visiting your parents for it to potentially turn into a lethal level of selfishness|0
Probably But even if we assume their numbers are correct it demonstrates how even early aggressive intervention far earlier and more aggressive than any Western country has implemented so far still results in huge numbers of casesPrimary and high schools are mostly still in session in the US and many people are still mocking companies choosing work from home or individuals choosing to stay home Its going to be a shitshow|0
More like all of them You people are fucking nuts|1
Well that ship alone has the worst outbreak outside of china right now If it was a country it would be 2nd total According to the official numbers of course which are to be doubted|0

This is going to be interesting if they determine that the man he had dinner with was not the source of this infection|1
And  You forgot who initiated the travel ban  Regardless if you think that a travel ban and taking tempatures at the airport is sufficent to contain this then you havent been paying attention  This is a virus that spreads without symptoms  That means that it will spread and pass through temp scans  It will spread internationally and someone that flew next to a sick Chinese passenger catches the infection and comes into the USOh look were starting to see cases in the US where the individual didnt have any connection to a flight from China  I wonder how that happenedThe China ban was to make the GOP feel like trump was doing something with as little money as possible without actually doing anything|0
WellI tend to consider me a scientific minded person but maybe I am a bit too concerned by the situationBut lets put it in perspective with some data1 Lets assume only for a moment that herd protection not a certain fact but lets assume it will be true is achieved with 50 infected lower than UK 60 estimate and then infection will die out2 Lets assume that its like a flu and according to latest CDC estimate httpswwwcdcgovfluaboutburdenpreliminaryinseasonestimateshtm 1  13 of the infected are hospitalized 360k610k hospitalized vs 36M61M infectedTake the lower number 1 3 Take a look at Italian open data website reporting all hospitalized Vs intensive care data httpsgithubcompcmdpcCOVID19blobmasterdatiandamentonazionaledpccovid19itaandamentonazionalecsv   lets verify the ratio  of intensive care terapiaintensiva  total hospitalized totaleospedalizzati the ratio is more or less 1520Lets take as usual by now the lower number 154 We know for sure this illness has a very high spreading rate but since we dont trust hypochondriacs or the media we measure it by counting only the number of hospitalized people ie people that following a medical examination are deemed too ill to shake it off at homeagain take a look at Italian open data since at the beginning no relevant containment measure were taken and since Italy is a first world country with free healthcare for everyone even illegal immigrants we can assume if you are seriously ill youll go to the hospitalif you sum up hospitalized  dead you have a rough estimate of people who have been at the hospital up to that day really we also have people recovered at the hospital and not at home but since we dont have separate data for the set we are not considering them at allyou can calculate easily that the doubling rate of badly affected people is between 23 daysWe have information that intensive care residency for previously healthy people is roughly 2weeksTherefore if in your government you have the best experts in logistics and we assume they are you can serve 26 people each year for each IC unit5 how many intensive care units do you have in your country I dont know but internet is my friendForbes has some fresh data httpswwwforbescomsitesniallmccarthy20200312thecountrieswiththemostcriticalcarebedspercapitainfographic Now to sum it upLets say you are in UKTotal population 67MYou need to have 50 33M infected to achieve herd immunityHow many serious cases we haveAccording to official UK data  httpswwwarcgiscomappsopsdashboardindexhtmlf94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14   we have 797 casesAt the moment Im not interested if data are up to date it will be a minor error in my calculation positive side effects of exponential functionsWe know 10 people are already dead and we dont know at least I cant find how many are hospitalizedLets say they are roughly 50 In Italy they are more but it will be a minor errorSo 400 people in the hospitalBased on CDC Flu statistics they are 1 of infected  40k people are infectedBased on Italian data 15 of hospitalized  are in ICU  30 peopleTo get 33M infected with Italian progression doubling every 3 days and no mitigating factors you roughly need between 27 and 30 days30 millions is between 40k29 and 40k210204M on the 9th of April409 M on the 12th of AprilReasonably there will be a plateau mitigating factors to the spread but its just a matter of a few daysweeks more if you dont take any measures of containment but we want herd immunity yeah butBefore reaching this number of infected you saturate your hospital ICUHow many ICU in England Check Forbes estimate 66 every 100k people  4422 ICU bedsGiven that hospitalized people have same progression of infectedIn 18 days you will have roughly 25k infected 40026 people needing an hospital bed and 15 of them needing an ICU 3840 peopleIn 21 days 3 weeks you will have roughly 51k infected 40027 people needing an hospital bed and 15 of them needing an ICU 7680 peopleLets suppose all ICU bed are free no other illness in the whole UK requiring ICU we are lucky from the 1st of April onward you can attend in ICU only 4422 peopleYou have to assume those needing ICU care and not having it instead of having roughly 66 chance of surviving they will die lets say 50 because we are positiveTherefore a no intervention policy in UK will probably kill 10k15k people by the 9th of April assuming  you have more or less 100k hospital bedsAnd if herd immunity is a fable Or we achieve it in a longer time Or mortality rises given you dont have enough hospital beds And if lasting health damages are suffered by the surviving hospitalized patientsProbably my calculation is far off the real number but I will not bet my life on it|0

Because China would be offended if the world considered Taiwan a separate country and not a province of China|0
What You think 150k got sick in Hubei per day Look you have to do 4 tests so 700k is realistically 175k people or something You are essentially saying people who show symptoms are 150175 or 85 of the people who are tested will show symptoms If that is the case we should see a reflection in data from elsewhere as well to confirm this such as Beijing Shanghai where things are a bit harder to hide or in foreign countries But it isnt the case And which report says there were 100k infected a few days ago|0
 Fear helpping nothing but decrease your immuabilityI didnt understand this one|0
In terms of an expected result for the age group as a whole thats already factored inIn terms of an individuals chance of ending up in ICU I agree it would need to be accounted for But thats not what these numbers are about|1
The Spanish flu spread because the end of WWIEditWorld war 1 19141918Spanish flu 1918Basically all the soldiers coming back home help spread the virus|0
Well hes right though its like the Spanish fluI mean its still around but we have a vaccine for it and we dont worry about it reallybut it sucked in 1918 Eventually this new virus will be not a big deal Hes the leader of the free world He has to not make it a huge deal yet Its going to come as a drip drip drip You would do the same if you were president|1
That means that on average 1 infected person will transmit the flu to about 1 other person|0

I see your marathon and I raise you St Patricks Day in IrelandAlso I do personally think the risk from runners contracting it from other runners is super low Anyone who has run a marathon would know that you are only in close quarters with other runners for the first few miles at most 1530 minutes Correct me if I mistaken but one instance of a unit covid19 is not associated with contraction of the disease you need a bit more exposure I would have more concern for the spectators|0

700 CDC positions remain unfilled due to hiring freezesCongress restored much of the budget which was heavily slashed by the proposal from the whitehouse  It wasnt due to lack of trying  More importantly budgets for global disease outbreaks were cuthttpsfortunecom20200226coronaviruscovid19cdcbudgetcutsustrump along with the epidemic task force  I would be completely unsurprised to find out funds were diverted to private parties and contracts instead  We had people on the ground in China and pulled them out because of these cutsDo you reckon that has anything to do with the fact that covid19 is highly transmissible while the patient is presymtomatic unlike SARS and MERSDo you reckon that the us testing a few hundred people is some kind of accomplishment when South Korea manages to test thousands of peopleDo you reckon that nottesting people gives you useful information about the spread of the disease  Do you realize that a percentage of false negatives does not keep some positive cases from being identified thus allowing better information than not testing at all  Do you realize that multiple rounds of testing can help identify false negative testsDo you think maybe its a problem that they outright refused to test symptomatic people because they didnt come directly from the Wuhan area and later China  Does it bother you that they are gagging public health officials and forcing everything to move up the chain before deciding what is politically suitable truth   Did that work in ChinaThere is blatant incompetence at best and its going to be costly|1

To everyone saying just get married and cancel the party  the heartbreak comes from having to cancel the party  The party theyve been dreaming of and the dream of having your family reunited  and the party youve likely sunk a lot of money into Its a bit trite to just say who cares about weddings if its not yoursThis is coming from someone who gives zero craps about weddings  but I feel awful for my poor sister who had been planning this beautiful ceremony for over a year|1

I am pretty mystified at this point  The conditions were met pretty much as soon as Italy exploded  Sure it could still be contained but thats a completely irrelevant point  We are at a pandemic situation  Call it whatever you want but it is a pandemic|1
Like the corona virus itself isnt enough I guess those people dont realize that their country is next and to be honoust I think italian reactions is pretty goodi doubt if all countries will react that way i hope the netherlands will but highly doubt it since they still seem to believe that asymptomic people dont spread the diseaseThanks i will have a look on those reddits some people just need to blame someone while i guess it is mainly a combo of bad luck and good response in italy I wouldnt be suprised if other countries did have people dying from corona but just didnt test|0

Meds can be provided if a person cant afford them Hospitals have some reserves but they arent sufficient to treat everyoneIn Ukraine GDP per capital is more than 3 times lower than in Russia so not surprising that the country cant afford medsOn the other hand availability of doctors is quite goodIve read horror stories here on reddit that in western countries it might take several hours to get seen by a doctor in case of emergency ER and getting an appointment might take weeksIn Ukraine from what Ive seen it is like 20 minutes in case of an emergency and maybe few hours to get an appointment unless you need a doctor with rare skills So its not all that bad I guess|0
COVID19 test kit suppliersDisclaimer I have not ordered from these companies buyer beware I wanted to let people know that there are suppliers out of China who can supply test kits for COVID19 I am sure some hospitals wish there were more supplies available as they are hard to come byhttpsmmadeinchinacomsearchsupplierwordTestkitCOVID19Also N95 and Surgical Masks httpsmmadeinchinacomsearchsupplierwordCOVID19MaskrespiratorToxic gas masks  I included this one because some have external tanks for breathing which may be needed for some hospitals  httpsmmadeinchinacomsearchsupplierwordToxic Gas MaskhttpswwwredditcomrCoronavirusFOScommentsfjoqbmcovid19testkitsuppliers|1

There probably is blame to go around but I certainly dont see trump being blame free He disbanded the USA pandemic response team in 2018 high chance it was solely because Obama started it has called it a Dem hoax and repeated this at rallys dont say it was a misunderstanding after his back tracking medical experts cant talk directly to press until the message has been cleared combine this with the CDC website now not updating infection numbers doesnt make it appear as if the WH is being transparent when the virus showed up in China there was no real measures taken to prepare for it coming to America Theres probably more but these points I think are good examples of how trump has failed to protect and inform the population|1

Thank for this well written and thorough reply This alleviates one of my two biggest fearsNow can you also knock out that peer reviewed brain stem paper that made it sound like this virus uses your neurons to get to your brain stem and bam you stop breathing Still searching the sub maybe this has been addressedFear wise I think we all have enough legitimate concern about what happens if the spread overwhelms healthcare systems I dont wanna worry about reinfections and zombie brain stems as well|1

You skipped the parts that werent convenient for youLets see1  I know you are but what am I2  If businesses have been trying to stay unregulated for 100plus years theyve failed and the regulators still havent met their aims3  Regulations arent the reason we arent using snakeoil and cocaine science is  some of it publicly funded some of it privately funded4  Government takeover is a simpleton answer Where you see an industry preying on the sick others see industries providing care that wasnt imaginable even 25 years ago5   It isnt just about recouping RD there are a bunch of loopholes that can prevent generics from coming to market A solution that doesnt require nationalization making the patent system fit for purpose again6  Good for you youve articulated one of the insuranceprovider problems Why dont we try to fix that before nationalizing Oh we are  the Trump administration is advocating for transparent pricing Go ahead and kneejerk criticize him now but it is fact7  Name a place where national health care continues to deliver an increasing standard of care absent innovation funded elsewhere for a larger group of people at a lower cost indefinitely You cant because it hasnt happenedEvidence that our current system sucks is NOT evidence that it must be nationalized Im not arguing against regulation Im arguing against our existing laws and regulations and against nationalization|1

It really depends on how contagious it is and how it spreads further Its all over Asia and confirmed in the US If the people in the US were contagious people on their flights and people in Chicago and Seattle are already infected I took a flight yesterday with people connecting from Japan and all over the US I only say this because that one flight had people from all over the world If its airborne like the senators are saying whole flights of people could be infected and further transmitting it|0

 Were not giving any advice other than wash handsexcept the most important bit of recent advice is to selfisolate for 7 days with either a fever or a new persistent cough If youre going to write panicky fearmongering threads on this subreddit at least get the facts right|0
The only good news is that there are probably many very mild cases because all people experience are slight fever or dry cough and mistake it for the flu or in some cases have no symptoms at all|0

Exceptionalism is a serious character flawI see a lot of that in Canadianwestern approach to life|0
I think all governments know they wont be able to contain it so they are now still trying to talk it down to calm the public so there is not too much strain on the whole system This might last for another few weeks until cases really start to ramp up and people start to realize this is going to get bad and get snapped out of their denialLike some top virologists already predicted 4070 of the population will get it eventually and we all have to accept the fact that there is a chance that we will get it eventually as well The important thing is that not all get infected at the same time but we manage to spread it out over a long period of time so the system can handle it If not things might turn uglySo it would be better to get infected now before the majority gets infected or after so you still get good treatmentThat virus will probably stay with us and return in a second wave next winter|1
It was a combination of things earlier today that prompted me to sell some of my positions even in the face of watching speedy market declines day after day1 Like you mentioned we are only down about a year of tremendous gains  Do I think this virus will make economic life worse than it was in Dec 2018  Yes in part because2 I live in Snohomish county WA and went out for some odds and ends at the grocery store this morning  People here are not being cautious even with the closures of schools businesses restaurants etc  They are stocking up for quarantine but arent exercising better hygiene and social distancing  Its as if this is a forecasted snowin and not a biological phenomenonMaybe this is all priced in  Maybe not which is why Im mostly in the market still  My guess is that eventually it will start to click with people as cases ramp up and national news has more and more tragedy to report on |0

Should an nba player not be prioritized They travel daily and interact with countless fans not to mention that as rich 2030 year olds they lead very active offcourt lives They have the potential to spread the virus to way more people than your average person does This is without getting into the benefits that shutting down sports brought in terms of societal awareness and limiting fans from coming to arenas|1

I live in Louisiana and nearly everyone I know is downplaying this and acting like its a conspiracy theory for the government to control us I dont understand how they could think a virus thats killing people is that Like do you want your loved ones to become sick because everyones allowed to roam as much as they want I guess I dont get what people expect I very much take this seriously It could happen to your loved ones or YOU And then the people that act like its no big deal because only older people die Ridiculous|0

Its pretty easy to make a small scale test that works  To make a test that works reliably with a low falsepositive and falsenegative rate thats stable over time that can be scaled up to give 100000 tests in a week that takes a while to make it and some time for testing and some scaleup time and some distribution time  Its not a trivial thing to just go bing and make a new test  You have to test it to make sure it works reliably otherwise you might clear people who are infected or tell people who are clean that they are infected and quarantine them  Its not something where you want to shoot from the hip|1

Dont discount the possibility it could just be based on crap science They seem to be relying heavily on behavioural economistsscientistsexperimental psychologists etc Im an experimental psychologist so I have nothing against that science but I also can see that psychology is far far different to epidemiology and the variables in psychology are huge because human behaviour is far more complex and unpredictable than viral behaviour I dont think they should be relying so heavily on this type of science for dealing with a pandemic Behavioural science is fairly new as a science especially in terms of using it for policy making and weve not had a massive pandemic like this in a very long time so have little data upon which to base our understanding of how people will behave given certain government actionsI am concerned that the Tories are a little infatuated with psychological science at the moment because theyve seen how successful it has been at producing referendumelection results But the problem is that electionsreferendums were won by using social media data to create personality profiles and then targeting very specific personality types with specific messaging to either encourage them to vote eg for brexit and others to persuade them to not vote eg people who were more likely to vote remain This is completely different to trying to figure out and nudge the behaviour of a whole population in the event of a pandemicYes they were incredibly successful in using behavioural science to win elections and that success was replicated in many countries so of course the politicians are all like oh my god these psychologists are amazing and so clever and magic We could use this science for EVERYTHING Remember though a lot of politicians dont have much science training at all and these psychologists are not necessarily likely to acknowledge theyre out of their depth and to say they want to defer to the epidemiologists whose methods are tried and tested|1

Thats organized religion run by people and not created by God People have different ideas about things some people can also use their religion to spread hate but it only represents them no one elseimagine that Sure but when majorities of a faith are hypocrites and only on the ride for the social aspect or to prey on the naive but genuine seekers and when revelation of other members criminal acts are swept under the rug Maybe you can see why I feel that wayYou know who else diddles kids Atheist pedophilesGranted But Ive never known an atheist pedo Ive never been a member of a flock of atheists that has known pedos in their midst that cover for each other and hide their sinful crimes Allowing ongoing indiscretions and perpetuating it further and further literal wolves in sheeps clothing leading and hurting the flockTalk about absolutism Not really I know there are genuine seekers in churches I just hope for their sake they find their way out of them before they are eaten alive I know Ive been dismissive earlier to you and for that I apologize as youve shown I may have reacted poorly to your intentionsYou sound like a very hateful person thanks for proving my point Im not Im actually a very emotional empathetic person Like big burly guy that doesnt cry over personal emotions like ever in my life but put on a documentary about 911 or the Las Vegas Harvest Festival shooting and Im streaming tears down my face in shame and sorrow that I even live on the same planet as people that can do these kinds of atrocities to each otherIm angry sure hurt jaded and cynical I can admit that My eyes are wide open not wide shut Ive got a short fuse for bullshit degeneracy and disingenuousnessFor example both you and the other commenter were so offended by my mockery of the idea that pence is simply a fraud when he holds a prayer meeting for a photo op to pray about coronavirus that they jumped on me with ad hominems and disgust at the sight of my words And then you comment in mild agreement oops that was the other person I was referring toI find it interesting because it was a generic comment directed at no one in particular besides pence who will obviously never see or be affected by it So the offense to what I said as described by the other poster oops that was actually youis amusing to me as it feels wholly disingenuous and perfunctory like they have to chime in and say something to defend themselves as if it were a personal attack on them Their tone and disgust did nothing but reinforce to me yet again that encounters with so called Christian zealots never lead to any substantive spiritual anythingOn the other hand you an agnostic who doesnt care either way if God is real engaged and with a few words moved me to a deeper consideration and exploration of my beliefs which I havent really done in a while leading me to do some reading and now having a dialogInteresting how this all worksI know you think Im a hateful person but hopefully you get something from what Ive said here at least Ive had this sort of discussion a few times with my mother trying to help her understand that yes the actions and things I became aware of over time in the church had a direct impact on my spiritual experience and decision to leave the faith and it burned this cynicism into meE oops I got you and the OP confused Im exhausted|0

Disclaimer not a doctor following are things jlearned from reading doctors explanations in the mediaFrom cases in China it seems like some ppls immune system react strongly to the virus and causes inflammation in multiple organs not just in the lungs resulting organ damage Lung damage is the primary damage though People who recover are not necessarily have immunity to it in the beginning Rather their immunity system is able to fight of the virus after a while But during this period the patient may have lung issues that affect breathing and absorption of oxygen resulting the need for hospitalization So the treatment mostly is focused on keeping the patient away from death due to symptoms like lack of oxygen and buy enough time for the immune system to fight it off And some just dont make it I havent seen any literature that studied what makes the immune response different between people Maybe there is and I would love to learn about it|0

It is interesting China had the lowest published death rate from SARS at 66 compared to 10 to 20 in developed countries This could be due to superior care though it would have to be for reasons different than those suggested here since no developed country was overloaded or it could be inaccurate data which given the history of that episode seems more likely Still mentioned since it is small evidence China might be adept at dealing with this illness|0

Good idea Ive been limiting my outings to either drive through including pharmacy or for pizza places I pay in advance and ask them to bring it to my car I park in front of their building so its only like a few feet away from the curb The place I usually get pizza from actually encouraged that as an option and is asking people to avoid going in or paying cash for delivery drivers to avoid contact instead paying in advance including tipTip Whatever food you get that is prepared by someone else microwave it first for like a minute at 1200W Just in case the person that made your food is an asymptomatic carrier and got virus particles on your food the microwave will basically sterilize the surface  if you microwave it enoughLately all Ive been getting is pizzas and theres little to no skin contact with the food after its taken out of the oven And the ovens pizzerias use to cook stuff get crazy hot Not going to any sit down type restaurants and especially no buffets Buffets always skeeved me out because of the shared surfaces and the possibility that some kid stuck his fingers in the food  as kids are known to be nasty pains in the ass like that And I really love Golden Corral Especially breakfast Gonna miss it But I just cant get past all the shared surfaces and potential for contaminationId get Chinese food but sadly no places around here have a drive through and Im too rural for things like Grubhub etc And like I said Im trying to avoid actually entering buildings for the next 4560 days So until this passes Ill satisfy my craving for that with those frozen Tai Pei General Tsos Chicken microwavable thingsThe only exception will be medical appointments that I have preexisting that have nothing to do with COVID19 Which in those offices they have hand sanitizer wall mounts all over the place which Ill be making use of and keeping hands from face until I get home and then wash hands and arm all the way up to elbow like surgeons doI am overdue for a new dental xray and cleaning but Im putting that off until this passesAlso due for Hepatitis B vaccine but delaying that too Its an intramuscular injection I wish they could just mail me the vaccine I could do it myself So I will only be leaving the house two times in the next 90 days Endocrinologist appointment  I see him every 3 months  and because of a rare disorder its important I see him and Pulmonologist annual appointment for sleep apnea follow up Thats itWhats nuts about the pulmonologist office is all they do is copy metadata off of an SD card thats in my CPAP machine If they would just set up a website where I could upload it or let me email the data I could avoid going there altogether All they do is copy files off the SD card which gives an Apnea Hypopnea Index number and if its high they order a new sleep study and I am able to check this number myself so I know in advance whether or not they are going to order one if its not that concludes the appointment So unnecessary but my Medicaid insurance requires it or they wont pay for CPAP replacement suppliesMy endocrinologist does actually check my glands and basically does a thorough physical and orders a slew of blood labs each time though so that definitely is something requiring my actual presence|1
This man is an incredibly brave individual Honestly the world needs more like him Hunted by the party for simply reporting facts Stay strong brother|1

Wow you were ahead of the game  Mid January for me|1
Best question of the entire night props to that reporter for yelling that out lol|1
Im not sure why youre being downvoted Youre right that this type of lockdown is not only unlikely in the US but also incredibly impractical This is only possible in China because you have high rise buildings that you can control inout access to easily with minimal security Imagine trying to do the same in american suburban neighborhoods Its not happeningMaybe in Manhattan or downtown Chicago youll see Wuhanlike lockdown but in most of America its more likely to be like Italy Schools closed Work closed Restaurants closed except for carry out They ask everybody to selfisolate and limit outings to grocery runs and emergencies|1
I think that means in the US and contracted hereThe other cases were flown in already infected from Wuhan and the cruise ship|0
Its weird how things come around eh The word quarantine originating from an Italian dialect from when they were being isolated there because of the Black Death plague believed to be originated in Asia btwThese things really amaze me its like history repeating itself You have to wonder Terrible news though|0

Good lists When dealing with an illness that spreads by droplets like this virus you also should wear goggles in any situation where youd wear a mask I think the top priority people can do in countries with 1 or no infections at the moment is to carry hand sanitizer everywhere with them and use that plus hand washing frequently Oh and get enough sleep There is an abundance of places online that give advice on how to build up disaster preps and as long as you avoid the truly kooky ones it can be a fun thing to get lost in over a weekend figuring out plans and such And no matter what happens with this virus if you make and follow a plan according to your budget and needs getting better prepared will give you a lot of underlying peace of mind |1
Thank you|1
There are inaccuracies in the numbers on this site and frankly everywhereThey report 1700 cases in New York Following their own link to source data  httpscoronavirushealthnygovcountycountybreakdownpositivecaseshttpscoronavirushealthnygovcountycountybreakdownpositivecases the number is 1374 the 1point3acres site has an unassigned county category that I cannot find anywhere on the New York State reporting NYC reports 1374 as their topline numberI dont think anyone is being malicious or purposeful its just really hard to get straight numbers in the US right now|1
Not really person may be not high in ladder or computer education to judge so he is asking just in case Its good to ask if not sure|1
The welding in Wuhan was used in few specific cases where morons like those two in Italy violated the voluntary quarantine Because you didnt do this no weldingThey didnt weldin the entire city or something yeah Have common sense and follow instructions and things go well|0
Please be careful with everything I read somewhere the germs from the virus can stay in the air for a while and they stay alive longer on metal surfaces Do your research while you wait and make sure youre cleaning everything your wife touches and that comes in contact with the baby Id be freaking out if I had a little one coming|1
DP is actually 7706  099 1 death of unknown ageHowever the deaths are extremely biased towards the oldest and so is the population of the shipIIRC The DP CFR for people over 70 is 17 5288 while under 70 it is 03 1331 was probably 60 Also CFR for over 80 is a massive 74 454This is well inline with the Chinese hospital data regarding age riskAt the moment my guess for the ICFR infected CFR is 02510 With the DP data so far I would guess its more towards 05 than 10|0
Thanks for the update on your area I was basing mine off my GPs email today They dont want any possible cases coming into the doctors office potentially infecting other patients  They want us to call public health|1
The formal excuse is that CDC only confirms tests done by their own labs The fact is that most labs are capable of doing the tests with little to no falsepositive since a lot of DNA techs are very cheap and accessible nowadays|1

Youre right  but that doesnt necessarily mean the actual process of testing takes that long Even if you cut all red tape that its safe to cut its still a very long way away As it should be ethically|0

Who knows when people will feel like going out to the movies again  Local theaters in my city  have set a 50 person max  I still wouldnt want to sit in a theater with 50 people|1
I agree Testing for health care workers and people admitted to hospital for severe symptoms should be tested as a priority Testing these cases must rise as demand does Not ramping up community testing alongside this effort will leave gaps in information crucial to the effort here in the Uk and globally against Coronavirus and ultimately add to the number of hospitalized people|1

Im fed up of the people saying this and that kills more and reciting death rates for various illnesses Then finishing off saying ONLY 1 dieOk lets go with 1 cfr for arguments sakeIf 20 of our 68mil population catch this virus Thats around 13600000 thats caught it With a cfr of only 1 136000 deaths Flu figures for our country are are 10000 deaths in a bad yearThis only 1 is really really getting on my nervesReally hoping that we do contain it But with there being community spread Im not holding much hope|0

Agreed I dont see the point any of the questions threads Actually i think we should only allow credible sources like Lancet New Journal Pubmed etcAnd if any one needs discussion it needs academic sources or you need to have expertise in biology or medicine etc Same with comments actually Look at how many are removed in the science subs We dont need input from people with zero expert knowledge At least not in this sub|1

I totally think its for appearances although theyve said its to avoid cross contamination But if the patient is not on isolation not referring to a Covid patient just anyone my scrubs go in and out of rooms without that much concern Why would a mask be different As far as I know theres no shortage of simple surgical masks so its not a matter of conserving supplies like it is with N95s|0
A lot of leaders will become infected and possibly die Im convinced Trump has it and hes high risk but its still early to tell and I could be 100 wrong Chaos will ensue because the public will panic Every man for themselves Violence and racism Murders Hate crime Looting Basically the purge The virus is scary but the people theyre scarier|0

Im also an epidemiologist and there are a number of more qualified epidemiologists professors with many publications who are arguing this could be the best approach Epidemiologists are split on the matter Its an inexact science based on prediction with limited data in idealised models You could easily build a model showing this approach would work out as much as you could build one showing it didnt Prediction in this case is borderline impossible because we havent seen anything like it prior and thus dont have good dataThe only correct position to support is the letter epidemiologists have signed asking for the government to make public the models supporting its decision making and thats ONLY sensible if publicising the data is not going to cause hysteria and thus cause greater harm|1

Thats the point sadly The administration is banking on the fact that if they fuck up the tests horribly then they can deny reality People will die But theyll say it was from the flu Because there was no test And Fox News will repeat it And horrible sad stupid people will believe it and repeat it themselves Its that simple|0

This is false The local doctors notified the local CDC on December 27th a study was conducted and the WHO was notified on December 31st They took a few weeks to develop a test kit and share the viral genome but this was hardly a cover upThere was some initial thought that the case numbers meant they had to have ignored it earlier but its rapid spread in other countries debunks that|0

this has to happen otherwise the sick with over run the hospital and take all the beds so that if someone comes in with any other medical issue they will be up shits creek we need designated Covid19 Facilities like we has during SARS Move resources to accommodate and all confirmed cases immediate evac to that facility with deep cleaning of that patient room and the room to either sideDedicated Ambulances for only Covid 19 transports that are strip to the bones to make cleaning easier Best PPE for the medic in these vehicles as well as some serious hazard payincentivesAmbulance act in Ontario allowing transport to these facilities and allow medics to do testing in people homes so they do not have to go to the hospital  More like a drive up mobile test clinic|1

Yea it irks me when some Americans look at one of the top sixth of countries by population in this case or often even one of the top tenth of countries and call it a small country The US is the third largest in the world an odd cutoff for large out of 200 countriesAnd I am irked at least as much when they use the argument that works in a small country but not here which is BIG even when the issue doesnt scale Thats a common excuse for no public healthcare too right how about each state has it then since theyre all small|0

Butthey didnt want to call it a pandemic when it was rapidly spreading out of China and into Singapore and Korea in fact the WHO even commended them for containment efforts Maybe downplaying it all that time and capitulating to protecting the reputation of the CCP wasnt such a great thing to do after all They waited until now March to call it what we have known it to be since January The fact of the matter is that many large organizations look to the WHO for guidance on what to do and they bear the responsibility of downplaying this for two months when it could have really made a difference|0
it could also mean that there are just way more undetected cases as far as I know at least in the beginning only more severe cases were tested|0

I dont think its that simple I was reading a comment by a nurse yesterday whos husband  is immune compromised She actually took a leave of absence because she cant afford for her husband to be infected  This thing may only kill 1 but thats still 100x more people than the flu kills How many nurses and doctors take care of aging parents at home or other immunecompromisedhighrisk patients  Probably quite a bit  I know two personally|0

I mean heshe isnt wrong These are the exact symptoms of anxietypanic attacks Now that isnt to say op isnt in some way ill but a high resting heart rate with no fever has not been reported as a symptom It is entirely likely because I have had anxiety attacks myself that op coughs and begins to worry which raises her heartrate which causes more panic By saying that it can be controlled by breathing is another sign that it is more mentally induced than physically Anxiety also takes a tole on your body physically resulting in that run down feeling they described Is it possible OP has Corona or some other illness yes Is it possible op is suffering from anxiety due to coronavirus also yes Qualification Someone who recently went to the ER twice and a cardiologist for undiagnosed anxiety and panic where my resting heart rate was over 140 at times Its scary and feels very very real and we will see a lot more situations like this as the virus continues to spread|0

America is already well past 10k cases Italy had 1 death two weeks ago Yet behind the scenes we can say at least 10k were already infected based on the deaths to date So with 19x as many deaths we can realistically say 50k are infected in america even  accounting for the fact that the old folks home was hit early More realisitically america is well beyond 100k infections and thats doubling just over every 2 days as basically no meaningful measures have been taken so far to limit spread america is looking a lot liek itll be at 1 million infections before anyone takes any measures like stopping public gatherings and likely at 10 million before serious measures like lockdowns are taken At which point well be at the point where its almost impossible to control in cities without insane measures like wuhan found because at least one person in every apartment block will have it|0

You have no sources first off I didnt feel the need to include sources for the two examples I gave that you could selfresearch in about 5 minutes or less Both of these examples are extremely well known and documentedbut it is paramount that we dont confuse genetic variation between populations as something to do with raceethnicity  It may not meet your PC view of the world but what do you think raceethnicity are other than very minor and for the most part insignificant genetic variations between populations that originated in a particular area People have different average heights skin colours facial features etc etc etc because of very small and unimportant except where health can be concerned genetic variations To suggest ethnicity doesnt have a genetic origin or actually exist at all is completely absurd Of course these things are spectra and many people will have mixes of genetics from different originsI for one am glad that we arent a world of clones|0

It is absolutely mindboggling to me how many people got that deep in their ideological bubble and echo chamber that they think censorship is a useable tool for anything Please take a step back and look at the big the really big atrocities that left a stain on humanity over the last century and longer And how many were implemented by well meaning or not governments without any accountability How many were fuckups where people tried to cover their ass or could do unspeakable things in the shadow of brutal raw powerDemocracy dies in silence If we could just trust the government to do the right thing we wouldnt need a democracy We would have a capable big brother who watches out for us How that worked out you can witness in China Or if we dont know enough about the current situation look at the famines under Stalin or Mao Without government accountability with censorship we dont get an efficient solution we get people in Chernobyl picking up scattered reactorparts  You get people put into camps for believing in the wrong god And we get the Princess Diamond if anyone hasnt grasped that yet Bureaucrats who think they dont need experts if they have a party line They are not efficient they are clueless idiots with a god complex incapable of grasping that you cant just implement a perfect plan and everything will be great There will be errors and we need a tool to give feedback about that or this will be another colossal fuckup leaving another stain on humanityBe it COVID the possible associated market crash or even panics WE can deal with that together It might get bad but we will get through this Without freedom of press without government accountability there is no we There is just a bunch dangerous fucking maniac who are playing with the lives of billions of peopleI hope many people just havent grasped yet what they are demanding here This isnt optional How delusional do you have to be to have learned nothing from the last century How many people are you willing to sacrifice for your fucking arrogance No you and your shiny system are not special It is the same dangerous idiots as alwaysedit Typo|0

 Do you have a source that local testing labs have the PCR test for the novel coronavirusYes herehttpswwwgenomewebcompcrcdcprovidestestprotocolnovelcoronavirusprepskitslocaluse It takes a bit of lead time for them to develop the protocol and distribute the relevant reagentskit materials Also kits dont get transported back and forth Samples might but not kits What do you mean by thisThe kits are the samples The kits are an allinone collectiontesting platform with multiple samples When a frontline care worker takes swabs and whatnot they take multiple for both local and CDC based testing Since its generically all part of one physical kit when theyre done locally they pack up the remaining intentionally unused samples and return them to the CDC for testing Nomenclature is rough here because at no point is there some kind of black box thats delivered to hospitals where peoples swabs get tested At every point a qualified virology lab is doing PCR technically rRTPCR assays so its not like its one simple box Here is the instruction set for doing one of these assayshttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovdownloadsrtpcrpanelfordetectioninstructionspdf It reads almost exactly like a highschool chemistry lab instruction set because thats what it is PYou can see from that link that only specific kinds of swab and collection materialsprotocol steps are allowed So basically this means that the people doing this specific work are using specific nonstandard material transiting it to specific labs and then retransporting that out to the CDCAs far as I know every other country is doing centralized testing  our most important priority is making sure that the test is accurate speed is important but accuracy is probably a priority Messonnier the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control saidSo broadly I think its fair to say that these produced reagents and packaged specific collection materials count as kits because theyre nonstandard and are intentionally inserted in the care regime for the sick for the purposes of conducting this fast and local but backed by national expertise testing regime|1

The staff are not currently using masks but from my understanding will be if there is a confirmed case this is just to help prevent spread and staff themselves becoming poorly People do not know how to put onremove a mask and most fiddle with it while it is on their face this can do more harm than good If there is a confirmed case in the home the resident is moved to a separate part of the home the other residents would be quarantined to their rooms This would give the staff a kind of buffer to use to prevent cross contamination Hopefully this would help prevent anyone else getting this virus I look at it as if it was my grandparents were in the home my partner works at I would be happy knowing they are in good hands|1

You dont need to ignore the signs  the signs are bad And of course doctors are preparing this is going to be really really bad They will be overwhelmed As I said to someone earlier its a matter of them either getting overwhelmed by a fuckton of people or a shitton Were aiming for shit ton here The measures are starting slow but when we are about to hit peak then we go into lockdown The government have made it clear its going to be bad and weve already started acting accordingly without even being told too The tubes are half empty I cant count how many people I know who have been told to work from home Were already slowing it down The measures WILL come I promise this is not done dastardly plan to kill us all off Theyve told us they will out us in lockdown at the peakIt will start slowly First wash your hands Now mass gatherings Then work from home then dont visit your older relatives then no weddings no parties then school closures then stay the fuck home then we mean it stay the fuck home|0
Love mine|1
Now were really ramping up and people are going to start to realize this isnt a joke right|0
My mom is almost 60 and works at the Salvation Army along with several others who are even older than she is and they havent closed down yet either I too dont understand why these kinds of places are still open now is not the time to go out bargain hunting especially since mainly seniors shop at these kinds of places Seems incredibly reckless for so called non profit organizations|1

Exactly my thoughts this morning I work in a factory with 500 employees Theres a ban for gatherings with 50 people whats the difference with working Its still a certain amount of people in a space at certain time Its greedy employers trying to hold out Because at the end of the day we are just a number|0
What are you talking about  I live here  there is no notice sent out omg|0
I feel like I dont have enough space to properly store more than 46 weeks worth for my family I wish I had a deep freezerYou know who I realized Im really worried about though All those kids who rely on free breakfast and lunch at school for half or more of their calories Once they shut down the schools those kids will be SOL|1

We will be Italy very shortly and its all thanks to these idiots in charge who are doing sweet fuck all|1
I have no problem leaving the house every 3 days I think thats excessive in general for me personally I am self employed work from home and its not unusual for me to leave the house just once every 2 weeks to make my trip to Trader Joes for food In case of CV I could easily stay home for over a month at a time I actually hate leaving the house and hate interacting with people As long as I have the internet I NEVER get bored the internet is all I need I also have Amazon Prime and Target free delivery thanks to my Red Card so I can basically get my entire life delivered to me|0
The confirmed numbers will jump and cause sticker shock in the public But mortality will drop Thats what we need to focus on|0
That shit goes wayyy up ur nose man Feels like to the brain|0
Based on the grumbling I have observed on Facebook Its like a scavenger hunt for toilet paper and grocery stores have been overwhelmed and decimated Ridiculous at how many people didnt prepare and all decided to panic on the same dayCases are just now starting to snowball and state and federal governments are just now taking action For those of us who watched Wuhan Italy and Iran we know this is really just the beginning People are going to be straight up kookydooks when sht really does hit the fanEdit typo|0
All the misinformation and other issues aside China created what I suspect will be a model response to a pandemic They failed to contain it but the authoritarians definitely slowed it down The West is not ready for what is about to happen and just asking everyone to politely stay home will not work|0

Healthcare does matter If we expect to believe that the jump from an animal was made in november to the lockdown of wuhan that is approximately the same time that italy had its first confirmed case to their lockdown Also Wuhan is packed all of Wuhan is bigger than my countryAustria so social distancing is very hard there and theyre bound to have many many infected which they probably do Also not every young guy is healthy Look at the statistics of italy Out of all those that died under 404 people all had health problems as in diabetes cancer or something of the sorts None died 30 or under and they probably have much more cases aswellas in 100k atleast Iran numbers are probably the highest at the moment because of shitty healthcare like I mentionedmost politicians infected which 100 means that their numbers are atleast 10 times underreported And im pretty sure that many think that Iran is a hot country Iran has lots of mountains just so you know Even if the temps would say 18 doesnt mean that the wind isnt cold|0
Its important to note that much of China is still under a quarantined lockdown|1
I had some initial faith in them in regards to reporting accurately whilst I disagreed with everything they were doing or not doing They can now fuck off entirely|0
Its only just the flu or a cold no need to take shelter|0
Really dont see how Budapest could be so bad with the current available data at least Relatively low numbers still schools finally closed universities have been closed for a while people generally understand the threat and social distancing seems to work major public gatherings canceled big sports events canceled etc Seems pretty good to me if anything|0
yea cus most of asia wears masks daily       Its like saying most of america seems to have enough bullets|1
Right I work for whole foods amazon and I dont understand what everybody is talking about We have a Team Member emergency relief program where if you donate you get access to Bezos just matched contributions at 16 million You can call on this program for things like paying rent  needing groceries car getting reps etc We also get 2 weeks PTO with a dr recommended quarantine or diagnosis We also have the choice to take unpaid leave indefinitely until we feel comfortable coming back to work so long as it matches the amount of FT hours we have actually workedThere is also a program where we can pool out PTO program that JOHN MACKEY not Jeff Bezos suggested everyone donate toward to help fellow team members It was not offensive to any workers at our store 170 team members From the public perspective its difficult to understand that Whole Foods and Amazon both do their best to not ask for any outside help and in return we do pur best to give you one of the only grocery stores in your city that is still 60 stockedBtw I make almost three times my states minimum wage and I am only 1 job code above a base Team Member The companys minimum wage is 15he even for PT workersThanks for bringing light to this Spread the word|1
Russian media is always playing down negative facts or making things up in favour for Kremlin So I am pretty sure its not an accurate number Source my gf is russian and we regularly watch RT You might have a look at the annual TV show Direct Line in which Putin is doing a scripted QA session with his folks as well Its full of symbolism ofc and you need to filter out the decorative content a bithttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiDirectLinewithVladimirPutinEdit worth to mention that the TV shows propaganda works pretty well for native Russians with soviet background eg her parents friends and family in Russia whilst she has grown up in Germany and can reflect it due to another perspective I guess|1

Why do you say theyre exploited Ive done plenty of casual work when I was younger as that suited my life when I was studying I wasnt exploited just because I was casual  the loading alone made it much more attractive as well as the flexibilityBut those jobs are not careers and you shouldnt be doing them for 10 years thats just a failure to grow up|0

Its adorable you ACTUALLY assume Im a Boomer Im not Im not even old enough to be your parent  I assure you I live all green in my day to day life down to driving an electric vehicle that I had to pay Extra for to do my part I pay for recycling as well I am well versed in what is going on in our climate and how previous generations before us have effected our daily lives I pay student loans off STILL because I Did the right thing I was born in the generation RIGHT BEFORE computers blew up My generation got the most fucked I assure you Younger ones You have an idea on where this world is going you know what fields to go in to make great money All the jobs we were promised went obsolete damn near on graduation dayThat being said Youre the kind of child Im talking about You want to bitch about the enviroment What have you dont to change it Anything besides type on your computer that is using electricity that hurts the enviroment every single day Do you even know how expensive living green is at all Electric cars Recycling no waste whole foods Do you know the cost of ANY of that I mean hell do you know the cost of a gallon of milk You blame the generation before you and yea sure Boomers ROYALLY fucked up Have you ever thought what world they all came from Ill tell you Every boomer grew up under parents who raised during the great depression This means they grew up in a world where money was saved and kids didnt get shit You went to bed hungry if you didnt eat the food on the table and that was normal It was normal to get beat by a belt every time you made a mistake So yes excuse the fuck out of them when they grew up they got some shit they wanted They didnt know about global warming They didnt design the college system They fucking raised you you idiot So before you assume each and every boomer is stupid and doesnt know what they are talking about realize they did grow up in a different world just like you are and your lack of empathy or understanding from where they are coming from puts you on par with Racism homophobia and all other ignorant forms of hate They all stem from a lack of empathy and understanding|0
The WHO put out the most important information and actions we must take to slow the spread of this virus down in late January Not enough people took it seriously It is easy to blame them even if the real blame is borne by millions of us who didnt take it seriouslyIT IS NOT TOO LATE TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCINGTell everyone you know|0
Wrong most of Germanys cases are of unknown origin Patient 0 for the cluster in Heinsberg district is unknown That cluster is by far the biggest one in Germany yet Most of them show mild symptoms so its most likely SCov Theres just 4 serious cases out of 172 cases in NRW right now where that cluster is spreading Thats very low compared to Italy who have nearly 300 people needing ICU but have less than 20 times the amount of cases as NRW in Germany has And Germany doesnt have a single confirmed death yetIm betting that Northern Italy mainly has LCov considering how many people seem to die there right now|0
well they got around to it at 6pm this evening 6666 increase in deaths from yesterday|1

Agree it is a cry wolf situation I am mostly like that with the news too I wasnt worried one bit about SARS or Swine flu or Bird Flu I always think nothing major will happen like ww3 total economic collapse or climate change but lately this one has been grabbing my attention from its sheer infectious rate and logistically difficult quarantine protocols that seem ineffective The fires of Australia and South America grabbed my attention and now things happening to the environment that are much sooner than expected is making me concern I cant ignore these things anymorex200BEdit Yeah totally forgot about Zika too it was more an isolated incident Now I am remembering the horrible birth defects it causes|0

My PhD dissertation is on environmental factors extreme precipitation temperature humidity and air quality on severe influenza infection so I wanted to provide some peer review so this analysis doesnt get overinterpreted by anyone hereTheres going to be quite a bit of ecological fallacyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiEcologicalfallacy in interpretting these results In other words there are likely larger variations in temperature and humidity within the counties analyzed than among the countries analyzed A second issue would be the lag time between date of infection and date of testing Theres an incubation period of 5 days from infection to first symptoms then an additional lag for symptom progression leading to testing  so environmental factors at the time of case reporting do not necessarily reflect environmental factors influencing transmission The third main issue is there are many larger confounding factors that would influence the rate of transmission of disease through the completely susceptible populations in these countries There may be and there likely are environmental factors influencing transmission but its unlikely that they represent sufficiently large proportions of the total risk of transmission|0
Because the premier League cancelled all the games that weekend That stopped around 500000 people traveling all over the country and packing into stadiums together That would of helped slow the spread In the conference yesterday they admitted we are a little further Infront of where they had anticipated meaning the spread of the virus was at an advanced stage If all those games had gone ahead we would have been in an even worse situation|0

Like I said I have really good insurance Everybody here in the US is at the mercy of what their employer can get them Its very confusing and many of us dont understand it eitherGallbladder removal surgery was considered lifesaving since I was in so much pain I was rendered completely incapacitated 300 wasnt a deductible only copays for two Emergency Department visits and one overnight stay no matter what the bill ended up beingI have another surgery coming up in May that will cost me 5000 close to that other persons 7K because that is the cap for outofpocket Also not technically at deductible but theyre charging me the max since its considered an elective surgery and not critical to my life I imagine this surgery bill will be closer to 75000 since its removal of my uterus cervix and fallopian tubes via robotic machinery|0

Ask to speak the hospital director Then contact the state Senators office the governors office the county and tell them the directors response It is unacceptable they will not test you Who knows if it was just a negligent doctor the hospital is lacking test kits but whatever is going on make it as public and bother them about it as much as you can If you can post on your social media so youre friends and family members from back home will do the same Request records from you ER visit too so you have their denial in writing Post the documentation too if you feel comfortable with that just black out any personal info besides your name Give em hell|0

Hopefully this new bill that the senate is going to vote on monday will add some security for you and other families out there that do not have any paid sick leave  As far as cleaning supplies dont overlook the dollar tree or any of the other everythings a dollar stores for disinfectant spray you can use 3 tablespoons of regular bleach  not scented or any of the other add ons to a gallon of water put it in a spray bottle and just lightly mist surfaces As far as extra food A bag of dried beans and a can of spam will make several meals I understand about the tax check but you can put away a weeks food for a small amount of money Just hang in there and be big about it in a few weeks when all those people finally start freaking out and dont tell them  I told you so|0

I have been warning my friends and family for 3 weeks My parents and grandparents have been saying that its not a big deal and that Im being ridiculous They think that the US is on the case and that we have nothing to be worried about because we dont have any confirmed cases in my state I try to tell them that we almost certainly do hell my Italian friend in one of my classes had her mom come visit a week or 2 ago Only my sister listened to me and got her supplies and stuff But she works at Starbucks She just had to leave work today because she started feeling quite sick went to the doctor and then he said she had some kind of virus and said she would be fine Didnt run any tests I told her to stay away from our grandparents for at least 2 weeks after she has no symptoms and that she really shouldnt go back to work yet until she gets tested or is better She said that she is ready to stay in the house bc she got supplies But she wasnt clear on if she was actually gonna do it She better not fucking go near our grandparents and even our parents but I just know that because they didnt test her they are gonna think that she definitely doesnt have it and not care if they are around her I hope she is ok luckily she is almost definitely going to be fine I am worried that she felt sick enough to go to the doctor though I hope she was just being careful Im so worried about my grandparents and parents Especially my grandparents theyre over 80 and are not taking it seriously I tell them what they need to do to be safe and my grandpa wouldnt even use sanitizer I offered him multiple times after he touched the fuckin buttons on the card reader at Walmart a few days ago My grandma is not doing well lately as it is and has stints in her heart She is in a lot of pain and thinks its possible she may need them put in her leg I told them to please let my mom I cant drive get them their groceries and to stay home They said they cant promise me that I understand if she needs to go to the doctor because shes in pain but in a week or so it is extremely likely you can get it at places like Walmart esp if you cant be trusted to even sanitize your hands I hope that she doesnt need surgery because by the time that they could even do it for her I bet our healthcare system will be completely overrun I have been so stressed and frustrated lately and everyone just tells me I need to tell my psychiatrist and that just pisses me off|1

Yeah I agree the border closings didnt make sense in terms of keeping the disease out at this point However I think there are another reason At this point we are not going to just flattening the curve I think the government Is planning to eradicate the disease within the country Thats why I think we will see a full lockdown of society where everyone will be quarantined in their homes If and when we eradicate the disease we will have to keep our borders closed until other countries has done the same|1

I had someone tell me The virus hasnt even hit us yet and less than 100 people have died You need to stop poisoning your brain with the mainstream mediaAfter I told him over 4k people have died worldwide since Jan 1st he said If that was the case people would be freaking out and businesses would be shutting down I told him how colleges are shutting down and going online only and a bunch of large conferences have shut down and he was like Huh But why didnt we freak out over H1N1 And I said Because we were stupid and it ended up killing a lot of people We dont want to sacrifice that many people this time so were taking it more seriously And that seemed to finally break through|0

Its never time to panic I keep saying this Its a time for deep concern Panic is bad  The problem is that once more people decide to take this serious they will panic because they are unprepared I am not a prepper type however I have collected equipment and come up with plans over the years as a just in case measure for various scenarios Because I already have plans to fall back on it is just a matter of enacting the appropriate plan for the situation In this case since this is a virus due to various factors both my gf and I would be in really bad shape if we were to be infected however in the event that one of us is to be infected I already have a plan in place for home quarantine that allows maximum mobility but at the same time would segregate us from each other to decrease the chance of infecting each other|0

This is my hope as well Yes this is much worse than the flu But look at our reactions and the precautions were taking compared to the flu That will help tremendouslyPeople see all the cancelled events and flights and think omg were fucked I see it and think thank god were taking this seriouslyIf a bunch of people who arent even sick decide to selfquarantine as much as possible it doesnt mean that the apocalypse is here It means were all doing something smart to help other people who may be more at risk were potentially freeing up hospital beds for people who need them and so onAnd youre right Even something as catastrophic the Spanish flu which killed mostly people in the prime of their lives often within 24 hours basically died out over the course of a month or two Dont panic Be smart and know that your preparation could save the lives of other people|1

The point is to institute a better healthcare plan by electing someone who has progressive healthcare policy I dont know how this is a hard concept to wrap your mind around Most other wealthy developed countries in the world have comparatively great healthcare instituted by their governments theres no reason the US cant do the same by electing the right kind of government As for paying for healthcare everyone in a functioning society pays into a pool that protects their society Healthcare is one of the fundamental societal protections  it benefits everyone to ensure as few people are sick and desperate as possible Americans pay mindnumbing amounts of money to prevent catastrophic financial disaster in the event of a serious healthcare event They pay far far more on average for inferior healthcare than a citizen from a country with universal healthcare pays These are all obvious things that shouldnt be that hard to wrap your mind aroundIve lived in Australia where healthcare is taxpayerfunded and in the US where healthcare costs are so potentially crippling that even people with health insurance tend to avoid seeing a doctor when common sense suggests they need to Let me put it this way if the US healthcare system was like Australias I would move to the US in a heartbeat There are so many truly beautiful places there But as it is now I would NEVER move to the US because the financial uncertainty presented by potential healthcare costs is a gamble far too big to take on for my family when we have a safe reliable alternative Im intimately familiar with both healthcare systems and have navigated them both and the USs system is like a nightmare world compared to the simplicity and reliability of AustraliasIts ridiculous and disingenuous to act as if governments cant institute good healthcare policies if good healthcare policies dont exist in a country Its akin to suggesting countries with functioning governments are incapable of progress or improving policy History shows infinite forward strides made by governments all over the world Sometimes they go backwards too sure  like a certain American president rolling back environmental regulations that protect clean air and water  but throwing up your hands in the air and saying There may as well be anarchy is intellectually lazy given demonstrated alternatives|1

That is smart to do Mild Asthmatics in absence of other comorbidities tend to do as well as other patients so far if the Chinese reports are to be believedIf you have asthma check your rescue inhalers and make sure they are not expired and have plenty of doses left If they dont call your providers office and ask them to order you a refill Also ask your provider for an action plan as to what to do should you start to develop symptoms and what they want for you|1

Honestly that kind of speculation is so very far fetched Germany has a decentralized system and hospitals and practitioners often decide whether to test themselves Anecdotally a friend of mine got tested immediately after she came back from Italy without any issues and I live in the NRW where the most cases are I have heard from many more people here that they had trouble with testing exactly in the NRW Obviously it is different from city to city and hospital to hospital  So maybe lets start pointing fingers at the hospitals that are actually irresponsible and push for the government to cancel events instead of speculating on what financial gain Germany MIGHT be after Stick to what is proven unfounded accusations only create panic and achieve nothing|0

If that were true then what is the materiality of suggesting the virus is alive for X number of days The virus being alive typically implies that the particle remains capable of conveying disease rather than that the virus is living which is a totally distinct philosophical debate irrelevant to this discussionI take live virus without further particulars to mean an infectious viral particleExceptions will state that a live virus has been weakened typically in the context of livevirus vaccines which still typically have some prospect of causing infection in limited cases Consequently if the virus remains alive on a surface for X number of days we must presume that it is infectious for the period during which it is said to be alive|1

httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed15923059So according to this study The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS epidemic in Asia and Northern America led to broad use of various types of disinfectant in order to control the public spread of the highly contagious virus However only limited data were available to demonstrate their efficacy against SARS coronavirus SARSCoV We therefore investigated eight disinfectants for their activity against SARSCoV according to prEN 14476 Four hand rubs were tested at 30s Sterillium based on 45 isopropanol 30 npropanol and 02 mecetronium etilsulphate Sterillium Rub based on 80 ethanol Sterillium Gel based on 85 ethanol Sterillium Virugard based on 95 ethanol Three surface disinfectants were investigated at 05 for 30 min and 60 min Mikrobac forte based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine Kohrsolin FF based on benzalkonium chloride glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride Dismozon pur based on magnesium monoperphthalate and one instrument disinfectant was investigated at 4 for 15 min 3 for 30 min and 2 for 60 min Korsolex basic based on glutaraldehyde and ethylenedioxydimethanol Three types of organic load were used 03 albumin 10 fetal calf serum and 03 albumin with 03 sheep erythrocytes Virus titres were determined by a quantitative test endpoint titration in 96well microtitre plates With all tested preparations SARSCoV was inactivated to below the limit of detection reduction factor mostly  or 4 regardless of the type of organic load In summary SARSCoV can be inactivated quite easily with many commonly used disinfectantsBut that was SARS not the current SARS2|1

Listen I dont need convincing I think vaccines are for the greater good I just think some doctors have fumbled the response in an effort to ease peoples minds and that has helped create this group of antivaxxers  I had seizures the day after my first MMR my mom was told it was a coincidence She asked multiple doctors if it was okay for me to get the second They told her it was When she brought me to the emergency room again after I got it the doctor said why on earth did you give her her MMR again when she was clearly allergic  It was a 5050 shot for years whether a doctor would believe I was high risk with vaccines That is no longer the case I couldnt find anyone to give me a flu shot last year because of my history In my lifetime Ive gone from doctors and nurses rolling their eyes when I said I was medically exempt from vaccines to believing me There are still vaccines I would get  I just more than most need to weigh the risk of the disease vs the risk of having an allergic reaction|0

I think the main issue with the rescheduling is not only that people have already made plans But the brunt of ramping up in NA for this virus is coming up at the point where young people party the most St Pattys and March Break Asking young people from 1824 or whatever to cancel the plans they look forward to for so long is a tall order I do think taking necessary precautions is important but I personally will not stop from doing things like working out and coming in close contact with others|1

I couldnt agree more and so glad you did to take steps to protect your family and as a result we help slow down spread and help everyone out Its navigating a combined selfish and selfless move I truly think the government here in California has no choice but to start shutting down schools next week or at most in two weeks Things are going to change rapidly in the next 2 weeks just like it did in the other countries Little Italy went from 1 to 3800 cases in 34 days and their population is tiny compared to us We can do things now to help stop it spreading|1

So I cant say for sure because I have wondered about this and I think that it varies by state but I have never paid a hospital bill in my life and it has never ended up on my credit and I have never been sued  I have had insurance almost every time I went to the hospital but yet ended up receiving a bill in the highhundreds or lowthousands of dollars every time  I find the entire system to be complete bullshit so this is my way of protesting  In theory they could sue you and definitely can put it on your credit but in my experience none of these bills have ended up on my credit report  I have a friend that ended up with a few different medical collections accounts on his credit and he just found a form letter online disputing the collections  By law the debtorcollections agency has to respond with proof of your debt being valid within a set period of time and they never do  Medical collections especially dont have the typical proof that a car loan or mortgage would have in order to prove that the debt is in fact valid  Thus IANAL but these have always been risks I was willing to take for the above reasons  I know for a fact that medical collections dont affect your credit in a huge way because theyre not the kind of debt that you really agreed to prior to taking it on    What Ive always found difficult to get an answer on is what kind of relief a collections agency can seek from you when it comes to hospital bills  Even in those cases they would still have to serve you with court papers and if its like most other types of debt theyre counting on you to not show up to court so that they can get a default judgment   However those people that do show up to court can typically get their case dismissed immediately by simply showing up and asking for proof    This is because the creditor normally doesnt have any proof that it is valid and is therefore only at court to try and get default judgments against all of the people that dont bother to show up|1
Yeah we just had our 2nd death here in NJ and our confirmed cases jumped to 69 positive cases with like at least dozens of pending tests going through labs atm One town next to where I live is in complete shut down because they just came back positive for 18 people in that town alone people suspect it was someone who attended a synagogue in NY most of NJ cases seem to have come from NYTheres no stopping it here Floodgates are open and were shifting from phase 1 to phase 2 of what Italy went through I dont want to scare you but this is the rundown of what happened there The context of it all just kind of makes you believe US will go more like Italy than SK httpstwittercomjasonvanschoorstatus1237142891077697538httpstwittercomjasonvanschoorstatus1237142891077697538 Also if there are any patients dying and no treatment option is working reach out to Chinese medical experts We had one young patient who nearly died Chinese experts recommended using chloroquine and Kaletra antimalarial and HIV meds to slow down virus while Patients symtpoms could be treated Im not sure how effective this will be on all patients and its probably not universal Maybe it only worked because he was young and healthy prior to the infection|0

Lovely so youre telling me that when I went to the doctor with symptoms similar to those of the corona virus Im pretty sure the only one I was missing was shortness of breathand then proceeded to ask me if I traveled outside the country it wouldnt have mattered I loooooove Pittsburgh Edit  for clarity I did test negative for strep throat and Flu I did travel earlier in February to Indiana Terre Haute in mid Feb thats the most travel I had done Im not saying I have the corona virus it just kind of frustrates me that even though they ask the questions they didnt have any of the resources to test despite Allegheny being a big healthcare county|1

I live in a smaller town 25k residents Our school district was shut down for a few weeks The school district has plans for supplying breakfasts and lunches to kids home from school the local food bank with aid from super markets and donations from citizens is doing the same and multiple local restaurants are offering free food to children while out of school because of the virus Delivery for parents without reliable transportation because we dont have  much public transportation out hereWere pretty poor we dont have a ton of resources and a lot of this is an ad hoc emergency plan set up by the school district volunteer organizations teachers parents and small business owners So why cant NYC|1
No  banning travel from one infected country to another isnt supported by the evidence|0
We did I feel like it may be because they know there are people in the hospitals who are going to test positive soon People are unbothered I feel like most people either think it cant happen to me or its just like a bad flu I mean if you need to see the mentality just go on the rest of reddit Every thread on rnba I want to respond You guys know theres not going to be playoffs this season right|1

  And even the result is positive they were asked to go home to selfquarantine with their whole family living together Love the antiCCP stance but if symptoms are mild they are supposed to go home  This applies to every country  I think the WHO stats is that 80 are sent home and only 20 are hospitalized with approx 5 needing intensive care  Dont be misinformed|1

Same here  trying tostay calm but im sick of the response ive had from others and trying not to be pissed half the time im watching this situation build up since the beginning and I feel like most of us internet saavy people can see what is coming The president my community and many others not so much Ive been called a tin foil hatter for telling people to be more careful and prepare just incase I try to give people information I get from here and WHO to people on social media and ive been met with utter disdain and contempt Ive never been a conspiracy theorist except maybe for that phase as an idiot teenager where I was like every other omg look at this alex jones guy welcome to the internet kid I believe in science and im being treated like some kind of flat earther for listening to scientists what the fuck is wrong with people httpsdennismichaellynchcomreportnerotrendsaftertrumpretweetsmemeofhimselfhttpsdennismichaellynchcomreportnerotrendsaftertrumpretweetsmemeofhimselfI found this meme all too fitting a poetic irony that trump retweeted it|0
I actually started pushing my family into buying stuff 3 weeks ago so were good for now But even without that I think the GP got enough time to start prepping seriously the lockdown on my region Veneto and Lombardia happened on the 7th and it took a few days before the entire nation got shut down I think many of us felt that with Lombardy and Veneto down two of the richest busiest parts of Italy and Europe we really were in for the long ride Ill add more in a secondI answered to another redditor in this thread on what to buy for a potential lockdown  Ill add that you should look into ways to keep your mind busy as well  buy stuff related to your hobbies books and other supplies that could help with keeping you and your loved ones entertained Look into exercises you can do at home its important to keep your body ready and going I just worked out with a Dua Lipa song ahahIf you have kids or older relatives start thinking about ways to explain them whats happening Maybe even write down a list of things that keep you motivated and uplift you  you know that board Homer Simpson made for his daughter That Do It For Her thing Something like that Youd be surprised how far that can get you ALSO Download Zoom its an app to videocall people I think to a max of 8 or 10 my friends and I have been using it to have long group calls and to see each other A friend of mine threw a video party to celebrate her graduation the other day it really did feel a bit like being all together again in a wayStay calm stay focused look up ways to keep yourself calm if anxiety kicks in download relaxing playlists for when you have to rechargecalm down and dont look up the news before going to sleep Once or if the lockdown comes try to sleep and wake up at normal hours It can really fuck your circadian rhythms up take it from me ahahLove and good luck |1
The original number came from someone though and I cant imagine it not coming from higher up But yes the issue is that no one knows I think as time goes on were going to discover that it was a blatant lie and that the tests were either never ordered or the actual number was substantially lower Just like Trump lying that anyone who wanted one could get one|1
Yeah should have said that a month ago|1

Right  Cringe worthy  My coworkers asked what happens in a state of emergency and I told them he is supposed to be stating that and all we saw were the Dow numbers increase for every company he listed like it was a goddamn sales pitch for economy rather than the safety of AmericansA few mentions of waivers for healthcare but otherwise it didnt really tell the public of the goal they have in mind other than increase stocks|1

Haha this press conference is so American Private companies advertising themselves during times of crisis|0
I disagree  I think that access to information about ones own health and the health of their loved ones gives them the opportunity to make informed decisions for themselves and the ones around them  Without testing this is impossible  These tests are not expensive or difficult to administer or  process  What would be the downside other than stock market decline to people learning the extent of the virus  People would naturally become more careful around everyone and would take all the reccomendations to slow the virus more seriously|1

Most countries wont and the fact is nothing will actually stop this besides a vaccine or enough people getting infected and recovered that a large percentage of the population has immunityThe game here is about slowing the spread and lowering the peak number of cases in a given area so the healthcare system can handle it You can likely do this just by closing schools closing large public venues like stadiumsparksconvention centers sending home all nonessential government workers and strongly encouraging the same from private employers|1

Thank you good sir No reason to make it worse if you can manage your symptoms Dont forget to donate blood if they ask for people to help with antibody transfusionsCDC says its an issue of when not if Once we start seeing evidence of infections in our city we plan to work from home Weve been putting away some more non perishable food and otc medicine We live close to a hospital and army base So if symptoms got bad even in the midst of the worse part of an outbreak I think we will be as okay as possiblePlan is to ride out the illness if we get it then help out if possible Donate plasma volunteer Immunity should last a few monthsWe will try and avoid infection as long as reasonably possible But this stuff is spreading like the flu So unless you can hole up in a concerted middle silo in the middle of Kansas for six months avoiding it 100 is extremely unlikelyI did a back of the envelop calc on infection rates hospitalization and number of beds in our city Assuming the army base builds out a temporary hospital I think wed manage to squeak by if covid hits like 60 of people like the flu can Our population density isnt as high as WuhanWe could go to parents house on the island but if we got seriously ill there is no real medical care there Its balancing infection risk vs complication risk and possibility of care|0

I really cant quite understand the American reaction I can understand shortages due to lack of planning and bureaucracy but this information is readily available and can significantly reduce the number of people who will get infected  it seems completely irresponsible not to publish it  In Israel for comparison every person who is diagnosed with COVID19 has his recent history published anonymously There is an official map created by the ministry of healthhttpsimohmapsarcgiscomappswebappviewerindexhtmlid20ded58639ff4d47a2e2e36af464c36elocalehe that lists all the places and times where known infected individuals have been and those who been in those places during those times are required by law to immediately self isolate for two weeks  Why would anybody withhold this information|0

This is twice as contagious then flu that was my point for flu those numbers be 6 people after 7 days not 250016000  If you have Corona you would have already infected most of the hood where you live and workAs for the incubation period its median 5 days after which the healthy become very ill and bed ridden with 39fever and recover within 23 days Same with the 33yo nonsymptomatic German that was sick over the weekend and feld good and went to work on Monday  Also this seems to affect old people worse so the ones needing urgent care seem to incubate only for 3 days and need 2 weeks treatment This was the case for the people in the Wuhan Hospital Study published in Lancet  So if you yourself have Coronavirus you would already at 7 days sent at least 500 old people in the hospital and will kill 50 in the next two weeks If your flu hasnt brought any grandpa down you have the common one or the swine one but not nCoV 2019|0

Even then its the same point The question is what will fuck up the economy moreItd be bad to take money from private utilities or corporations to subsidize this but its a one or the other situation one has to get fucked over in this situationFor the spread of the coronavirus its more effective to say to private utilities and corporations you have to take this for right now because theyll survive it without a problem The only other option would be put it on the rank and file people who are being put into quarantine watch as everyone in the world whos one paycheck away from living on the streets end up homeless because they dont freeze payments and all the homeless people end up spreading the disease becausewell they cant go in quarantine if they have nowhere else to go  Both sides fuck someone over but in the latter one you still have the problem with the disease to also deal with and now youve got a massive homeless issue on top of that|0

Some people had become homeless Those people are come from other province to work in Wuhan when they have work the employer provide living quarters for hem But after lockdown they dont have work and can not go back to home  They become homeless for about 40 days until some media and social media like Weibo talked about them many people is angry on local gov do nothing when their suffers  After that local gov provide them some hotel and a compensation about 400 3000 RMB  Other than that I think most Chinese people has some saves for them to   e to work in Wuhan when they have work the employer provide living quarters for hem But after lockdown they dont have work and can not go back to home|1

Based on the reports 1716 medical workers in wuhan have contracted the virus and resulted in 6 fatalities as of last week Ill refrain from commenting more on this in particular interpret these numbers as you willI would argue however the extreme conditions in Wuhan would absolutely affect mortality rate and the numbers in that city point to above 2We definitely shouldnt downplay this but also keep in mind that overcrowded hospitals are a biohazard waiting to happen and lots of people die from secondary infections Stress and exhaustion also trash your immune system If anything mortality rate of medical workers in Wuhan could seen as sort of an upper bound But your guess is as good as mineAnecdotal For what its worth my family is from Wuhan and I have a cousin who is a doctor there Yeah youd think doctors would get the best of treatment but from what I hear this isnt always the case  Ironically many are terrible at taking care of themselves even in normal times  Now factor in the current situation|1

I hear what you are saying but I dont agree  We dont have to and should never accept our leaders lying to us and we shouldnt have to read between the lines or expect that everyone else is going to be able to read between the lines just because we canThis is why we have freedom of speech  We dont need freedom of speech to praise the status quo  You can live a very happy life in China praising Xi and the CCP will likely never have cause to arrest you as a disident speak against Xi or China and that is a different story  Just n this sub alone there are multiple posts criticizing doomers for recognizing the reality and dangers of this virus and for trying to increase awareness that criticism is misguided  There is some litter and nonsense but nothing like the stuff being pushed to the mainstream to sell propaganda As for our elected officials  I have seen very few examples of leadership from them and they deserve to be called out and held accountable  We set the standard that the elected operate by with our commentary  We should share it accurately frequently and loudly  In that sense we need to do a better job because the bar that our elected officials are measuring themselves against especially when it comes to COVID19 is currently not very high|1

No I dont think they would But blaming the government for something like this is ridiculous Why dont we blame Iran Or Italy Or germany How many came in here infected from Vietnam Or the Philippines This shit has been out of control for months Those little SE Asian countries are not being truthful with their numbers Im sure NK is burning infected villages down to maintain their image too This thing was worldwide in early January China fucked up by letting it run a few weeks before they even considered testing for it in the first place Then when it was reported on they arrested the people talking about it and shut down Chinese twitter They started a quarantine 2 months after it should have been enacted China is the problem here The rest of the world is the victim|0

Im not saying the medical field is perfect it never has been and probably never will I should be surprised by your tidbit about MS but unfortunately were all taught to be familiar with the dark parts of medical history Ill also say that the majority of docs you mention are predominantly from an older generation one that had it much easier with certification and one that is unfortunately partially dominated by a more paternalistic sentiment Im not sure about the demographics of your experiences but you may find that the younger docs are the ones who practice more patient centered care as their training is the closest to ours which emphasizes being a partner as opposed to a dictator in the patients care Sometimes patients may not know what theyre experiencing thats why we need doctors But I agree the vast majority of the time a patient gives useful information that is critical to establishing solid care and patient autonomy is drilled into our heads early on unless its something thats immediately lifethreatening the patient is consulted and consented on their preferred treatment plan chemotherapy included were also rapidly moving into more targeted and less barbaric therapiesYou accuse us of being mindless drones were not Medicine is supposed to be evidencebased and a lot of the time docs are hesitant to pursue a new treatment plan because theyve read about conflicting studies or because theres simply not enough evidence andor consensus out there to make a sure choice And while you may call some docs lazy Ill say theyre sometimes just overworked In the end doctors are just employees of the hospital system they have little say in the hours theyre supposed to work and the administrative responsibilities that are thrust upon them That isnt an excuse for them sometimes not paying attention to their patient but what Im trying to say is that most doctors especially those of the younger generation wouldnt be in the medical field if they only cared about money and glory We wouldnt go hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt sometimes work for 80 hours a week and sacrifice the prime time in our lives to learning encyclopedias of information if we didnt at least give a little bit of a damn towards the patientI appreciate the concern Im doing my best to stay healthy and up to date I wouldnt be on this sub if I wasnt Good luck to you too|1

You were so close Second World was the Warsaw Pact world not with a connotation of second best but because it was the second superpower in a bipolar world Third World did not mean nondemocracies it meant non affiliated with either superpower bloc Famous among them was the NonAligned Movement NAM which included countries like India They formalized the concept of Third World to mean they were not going to be put up being bullied by either the First or Second World power blocs The remaining Third World countries tended to get sucked into proxy wars It really didnt come down to democracy vs communism either it was more NATO vs Warsaw Pact Most NATO countries were democratic and capitalist but NATO cooperated with dictators sometimes as part of the containment strategy South Korea and Taiwan were very authoritarian countries at one point in time Warsaw Pact similarly cooperated with democracies it tried to court India early on too So this is all very silly because the Warsaw Pact is dead and NATO includes most of Europe now Whether one country becomes less democratic or more communist doesnt matter because the fundamental antithetical relationship between Warsaw Pact and NATO is dead|0

Release of emergency funding to provide testing and support to third world countries Thailand will probably see a dramatic increase in the number of cases confirmed because they stated they didnt have the resources to contain the virus|1
WHO has been screaming that this is a world health emergency since late January I dont know why people keep thinking they have been relaxing until recently|0
Thanks for the post As an American in Hefei Anhui Province it is nice to see something other than the scaremongering and rumors and blatant outright lies and propaganda I am going to stop getting on Reddit if everyone really thinks everyone is being barricaded in their homesYes people are staying in and taking precautions No its not some dystopian tyranny|0

You gotta be kidding me|1
the videos are good but its also not significantly different than what the CDC and WHO are reporting just a little more context on top of itif the CDC did what reddit seems to have expected them to do announce a pandemic 2 weeks ago test everyone for COVID wed probably already have thousands of people lining up at hospitals trying to get their regular cold symptoms checked for COVID straining our healthcare infrastructure while probably increasing the amount of infections|1
Not my fault who knew 4 weeks ago this Democrat hoax would be so serious Blame Obama|0
Honestly I keep seeing people saying landlords should just eat the costs of not paying rent but IMO the onus should be on the government to keep rent being paid Whats your monthly rent Ok done|1

Yes it is FAR more contagious He points out Ebola kills 80 of those it infects in some areasbut it is also difficult to transmitSo while COVID19 so far kills 34 of those it infects it also infects a LOT MORE peopleThe seasonal flu only kills 01 of those it infects yet kills anywhere from 12000  60000 a yearIt is also spreading exponentially|0

You need antibodies whether theyre homemade or store bought doesnt much matter Unfortunately this virus might mutate enough that previous infections offer only partial protection against reinfection kinda like the common cold Hopefully itll become less lethal over time|1

I would just take him to the hospital If they dont want to test him cause they really dont want numbers to go up thats fine they can put him in the part of the hospital that doesnt have covid cases and watch that shit spread everywhere test complete|0
I understand your view that its not worth it to travel to sit in a stadium but as someone who sat in the stadium in Rio and then watched a World Series game in 2016 its really different But when global health is at stake I entirely support that and think that its best for people to stay at home should japanthe IOC not do anything|1
I had the same idea The short answer is too much Chloroquin is a medication that requires a specific dosagetoo little and it wont work too much and you can seriously poison yourself The poisoning risk is why the FDA dramatically limited its use|0

 If SARS didnt curb such practices nothing will And I say this as an ethnic Chinese who sees this practice even among my fellow countryman in my own country SingaporeChange is often gradual  It may take something worse than SARS to wake them up though  CCP would probably like many of these practices to end but its political and they need to keep their grip on power so cant tell people whove been eating bat soup and raw baby mice their whole lives they cant now|0
Orange Idiot Im talking to you|0
Shouldnt come as any surprise really the incubation period is 2 WEEKS and you are asymptomatic which allows it to spread Plus it manifests itself as coldlike symptoms so people might downplay it and continue on But the mortality rate is just much worse than the common cold or influenza|0
Its looking like this could change many many things|1
First they should just stop being poor|0
Yes I wrote Note that the data also suggests that smokers who do get ill may more often have severe illnessHowever these numbers are not in that study where did they come from 9 out of 21 exsmokers 42 and 29 out of 137 current smokers 21 suffering severe symptoms Vs 134 out of 927 neversmokers 14Edit Sorry now I see what you did Those numbers are correct|0
The sense I get is that western governments are generally telling people not to wear masks and stay away from people Its feasible in most of the west outside of big cities where most commute by car and there is more open space In most of Asia people are literally living on top of each other take public transit and generally impossible to avoid crowds in this case its impossible to avoid people coughing and sneezing around you The advice is stay more than 2 meters away from people but imagine trying that in a crowded subway its just impossible So wearing a mask is essential here Anecdotally a medicial professor here in Hong Kong just said that the flu season was cut short drastically from a normal of roughly 90 days to around 30 days this year no doubt that anti coronavirus measures are working|0

Hi Without naming and shaming I have a PhD in Maths from one of the universities whose signatories are listed in the letter I personally know two of the more senior academics on that list They have nothing to do with modelling of infectious diseases they work in algebraic topology a completely unrelated area There are also PhD students on that list who work in unrelated areas I definitely wouldnt count myself as qualified to have an opinion on the coronavirus response which informs public policy and neither should theyThe letter may have been wellmeaning and I respect their right to voice dissenting opinions to official advice Based on my experience at the university in question whats likely happened is its been sent round a mailing list somewhere a lot of people who agree with the broad notion have signed it and then theyve been lumped under the heading of scientists by those reporting itWhile your point is valid and its eminently possible that some of the people on the list do work in infectious disease modelling I cant speak for the entirety of the list we shouldnt assume that the people on the list are qualified to sign it Some of them arent and those are just the ones I know many more wont be as well|1

Or the issue was specific to mice and does not occur in Old World monkeys which would be a Good Thing considering that great apesincluding usare also technically in the same clade as Old World monkeysThe paperhttpsjournalsplosorgplosonearticlefileid101371journalpone0035421typeprintable hypothesizes the issue is with nucleocapsids in SARS proper but the mouse strains used in the study BALBc and C57BL6 strains do have their own immunologic eccentricities compared to Rhesus macaques  BALBc is known for producing plasmacytomas on injection with mineral oila process similar to how domestic cats can develop sarcomas at injection sites but a process that doesnt occur in primates  C57BL6 is a very very common strain for transgenic mouse research including genetic knockout mice its also a strain of mice prone to neurotic barbering seem to have increased pain and tactile sensitivity in general and are prone enough to morphine addiction and alcoholism that they tend to be used in animal models of addiction disordersIll also note their observations in mice dont seem to indicate its ADE which is why its not a good idea to get dengue fever twiceand which is due to an antibody response by memory B cells accidentally letting Bad Things In instead of killing them but a helper T cell type 2 or Th2 hypersensitivityeffectively an allergic reactionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiThelpercellTh1Th2model of the same sort that in lessgenerallyhygenic times protected one against the likes of hookworm infestation and nowadays tend to be the cause of things like hay fever and asthma when the local tree and flower population starts pollinatingPut more simply Apparently the mice had a touch of asthma or allergic bronchitis after being exposed to SARS after being vaccinated for it and frankly that could be a mousespecific reaction or even specific to these two strains of miceAlso It could be something specific to SARS in animal models that isnt applicable to COVID19As for the preprint paper it seems they used a slightly different approachinstead of using nucleocapsids aka bits of the outer coat of the virus made into a vaccine they did a recombinant vaccine using genes from SARSCoV to express other specific proteins that the body attacks and inserted that into adenovirusesand these did NOT give the macaques asthma and did quite a good job protecting them from SARS for realOf note recombinant adenoviral vaccines are a bit of a New Hotness  The concept has been used in gene therapy in which people get an engineered adenovirus to cure a bad genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis many of the HIV vaccines under development are recombinant adenoviral vaccines some malaria vaccines in development are using this approach and probably the first really big success of recombinant viral vaccines are modern Ebola vaccines like Ervebohttpswwwfdagovnewseventspressannouncementsfirstfdaapprovedvaccinepreventionebolavirusdiseasemarkingcriticalmilestonepublichealth|0

As a person who lived in SK during the Swine Flu Bird Flu and Hoof and Mouth epidemics Koreans take stuff like this VERY seriously and their public health systems are REALLY on point Plus they have social medicineits not free but you can get and afford medical care Its a system the US one could be based onat least as a startThe main difference is cultural Koreans trust their government as far as dealing with epidemicsso they cooperate mostly with behavioral changes cultural changes and somehow their government wasnt okay with having their population culled by 10ours is ready tolet the ENTIRE SERVICE INDUSTRY LOSE THEIR INCOME AND HOMES BEFORE ANYONE REALIZES WE CANT LIVE EVEN A WEEK WITHOUT PAYSorry Just concerned about my impending homelessnessno one else is|1
On a brighter note Happy Cake Day|1
Well if were free to critique WHO people should have a read of the conclusion page of this report     Its an interesting UK government report produced for the EU  critiquing how H1N1 was handled Discusses WHO transparency issues and excessive influence from pharmaceutical industry  Council of Europe  2010    httpassemblycoeintCommitteeDocs201020100604H1N1pandemicEpdf|1
Another possibly important piece of information here is that they investigated the first 41 cases of which 6 patients died making it 15 mortality rate This is much more relevant than comparing currently reported 40 deaths to 1300 infected because of two reasons1it usually takes 45 weeks to die or recover so it makes no sense to include all currently known cases but it makes sense to do the stats on those who go sick in the first wave 2Current situation in China is a total chaos with overcrowded hospitals and the data is not reliable People cant even get a basic medical attention let alone be tested by the lab But it doesnt mean that the mortality is near 15 It might be for cases serious enough to make people admit to a hospital We dont know how many people in the first wave got sick but had only mild symptoms treated then at home and recovered and are outside of any stats|0
Im sure it helps them to get the data out much soonerSay they receive two reports of coronavirus from a particular jurisdiction that might be two separate patients or it might be one patient who was transferred between two hospitals and who generated two reportsRather than chase down the paper trail for every specific case in such detail which is expensive and time consuming they can instead choose to prioritize delivering a timely response with goodenough data to tell us the general pictureI much prefer this rather than having to wait extra time|1
We need Disney World closed too in Florida Disney World is an extremely popular hub for travelerslocals BrazilEurope fly to Orlando by the truckloads Granted Europe got banned but UKIreland is still free to come so that will add possible infection With Disney World closed it makes a lot of tourists think otherwise to go to OrlandoKissimee area|1

Im a technician for mercedes benz in a city area They served us omelettes today from a catering company everyone lined up in a tight formation There is scrapes of work coming in compared to what we usually get I honestly just want to call sick to stay out of this Dont even care if I get paid or not This is extremely ridiculous to keep these public businesses open during this outbreak|0
Same here I did it weeks ago and I think it is going to be my new normal I cant even express how much less stress I have because I can go weeks without going to the grocery store|0

The hundreds of thousands of people in the west who died from the Spanish Flu Smallpox Measles  Hong Kong Flu Swine Flu Avian Flu HIV SARS have been very lucky yeah The most notable difference this time is that every man woman their baby and their dog have the option to weigh in and add to peoples terror of a new virus|0

How in The fuck are celebrities with no symptoms getting tested when people who have symptoms cant get tested They always show no symptoms and say they are fine with celebrities doing that it is downplaying the virus and taking a test kit away from someone who could really use it|0

 Its weird when you watch it spread in real time Just keep in mind youre actually not Youre watching it being tested in real time It was spreading 6 weeks ago|0

HIV started before my lifetime and was identified in 1981a bit after my lifetime startedAnd excuse my sense of humor but you arent in risk of catching aids because someone farted in your elevator rideNcov on the other hand it is a serious possibility given the nature of itAlso we are two months into the officially stated outbreak and we are stareing at cooked numbers and flight bans compared to an official 40 year period of HIV and no flight bans over itEbola would made a better examplebut please do go on because I find the notion interestingWhat else is on par to ncov|1
I recall a prior employer giving us flex days  if there were not used as sick days they could be taken as vacation at the end of the year The office was filled with a cacophony of coughing and sneezing in the spring by those who wanted to save sick days for a late year trip|1

Better not to get it at all While its statistically unlikely that youll have a severe case of covid19 if youre young and in reasonably good shape it is still possible Back in October I was a very fit marathoner and a staph infection almost killed me I was on a vent for 2 months Believe me when I say its better to not get sick at all|1

That site says raw food products contain the virus  I dont thi k that is true  It came from bats who are notorious for spreading human viruses  I dont think ordering sushi is going to put you at any additional risk than eating at any other restaurant|0
Note For those considering wearing surgical masks not n95 though those arent recommended either Wearing a mask doesnt do much to protect you from getting it its largely to prevent those who are sick or who might spread pathogens during surgery or in a hospital like nurses and doctors Wearing a mask is to try and prevent the mask wearer from spreading anything not from catching anything Wearing a mask in public may get you strange looks and keep people away but viruses on surfaces and things doesnt care if youre wearing a mask theyll transfer just the same|0
That is truly terrifying|0

Hi I wrote a blog article about this  but honestly its just my opinion as an anonymous doctor In short I think the covid19 story still has a lot of unknowns It can still blow over seasons ending or the virus can mutate and tear the world apart We just dont know but fear mongering stories tend to be promoted via social media algorithms x200B httpsgreysheepmdcom20200229twocasesofcovid19communityspreadincaliforniaandsomeqahttpsgreysheepmdcom20200229twocasesofcovid19communityspreadincaliforniaandsomeqa|1
Your post is still misleading if youre allowing people to infer that these videos are new The fact people are still collapsing isnt the point  as I havent seen these clips I inferred they were new You shouldnt mislead people because you think dating clips is irrelevant when it contributes to misinformation about a virus where misinformation is pretty rampant|0
Ive been talking to people around town here and many people dont believe that its going to be bad at all They roll their eyes at me and say that everything is an over reaction I pray that the people taking precautions make enough of a difference to start flattening the curve|0

Unless the government implements some form of UBI or suspends rent and mortgage payments a twomonth lockdown is unrealistic Remember not everyone works in an office or has the opportunity to work from home My household is one of many that cant work from home as we all work in restaurants or stores if the government does not implement something to help how are we supposed to buy food Or pay rentbills Would it even be feasible to shut down a country with over 300 million people Sure many European countries are doing it but those countries are not the same as the US in economics or government Theyre not as large as us And how would you keep everyone home Would you deploy the military I dont think anyone is going to appreciate having armed soldiers roam their street|1
More importantly masks disrupt automatic systems of tracking citizens activity based on facial recognition No wonder government big companies and media are against masks|1
Ideally though I may be off to Bali with its not yet recorded a single case all because of prayers no coronavirus tests at the hospital if you havent been to China policies|1
All masks have the benefit of not allowing you to touch your face whic is one of the main way infection is spread person touches contaminated surface then often subconsciously bites their nails picks their nose scratches their chin etc So even a shitty mask is better than none|1

How much time could it be possible to infect someone else after having recovered from the virus Two days ago I had some fever and headache and I recovered the same day it only lasted like 16 hours although its probably it wasnt the covid19 Soon Im going to visit my parents so I wanted to ask this just in case|1

I have loved this movie for many years But hes just another Hollywood elite with all the answers lamenting that if only people would just listen to him he could fix everything Yea right Forgive me for being skeptical You cant just write the ending you want and just have it magically come true This guy is an expert in what field Oh yea making shit up Is the US as prepared as it should be given that this is the whole reason the CDC even exists Obviously not And Im a little pissed off about it But the CDC wasnt created yesterday Theres a long line of blame to be dished out if youre going to start pointing fingers It shouldve been prepared for this a long time ago|0

For those thinking about how to make bread Artisan Bread in 5 minutes a dayhttpswwwfoodcomrecipe5minuteartisanbread325571 is worth looking up onlineYes its a book but the recipe is easy enough four ingredients you store the wet mix in the fridge for up to two weeks and when ready to bake bread  baguettes it also makes a good pizza dough you take it out handle it to form it wait 20 minutes for it to do its thing rise a little and bakeSource have been baking with this method for a while and have a 25lb bag from Costco|1

A new law passed by which functioning legislative body in the country that isnt being held hostage by an old man from Alabama Will this be faster or slower than a minimally administrated UBIAll resources are limited but not all limits are equal You have yet to prove that there simply isnt enough to give everyone assistance still under the assumption that the only viable solution is to pool cash to give to as few people as possible while taking from said pool to establish administrative positions to determine how few people possible can be helped|1
Furthermore Im talking about the UK specifically  the WHO are talking about pandemics Im talking about epidemics I take it you know the differenceI do from WHOs perspective certainly and they are saying that if you take that attitude you mentionedChina took extremely drastic measures to cut spreadIt can be containedI take if youve been listening to WHO as you claim youll know even theyve said there is no accepted definition for pandemic which made the comment today about it being a global epidemic give me a chuckleIm not being lazy or selfish Im being pragmaticYoure being unempathetically detached from reality Having watched this since the end of january I noticed the 80 suggestion but I didnt mention because im still trying to be optimisticHowever the fact that you and I suspect many others can rationally accept deaths in the 100000s of our elderly and most vulnerable members of our society when there are clear examples of how a few months of discipline can radically reduce thatTo think of the years our ancestors spent in wartime conditions rationing under the threat of bombings and invasion The moral bankruptcy our society has plunged to makes me fucking sick|0

I doubt how practical it is to carry the same testing out in the USThe cases in Korea are quite concentrated in one area and many of them are closely connected to one church These connections help to narrow down who to test about the virus Even the Korean government has made great efforts to test more people the number is still only a faction of the total populationNow in the US it seems to me that the cases are distributed well in many states I dont not how the testing should be arranged Unless the testing number is enlarged by perhaps 10 times But is that possible|1

Seriously I understand a grain of salt warning but you all realize theyre not quarantining 16 million people because things are fine right Does it perhaps seem the guy really didnt want to share it and hates where hes currently sitting in life and truly wanted to share so people know Whats unfolding around the world isnt fine folks the odds of an Italian posting this for real is pretty good no matter how many ways you may want to deny it Its not asking for money its not scamming anyone its trying to say in desperation he feels abandonedIt also makes sense his family may actually have been abandoned due to overburdened resources which is also why a quarantine makes senseAre people really experts at refuting attention whores or is someone possibly sitting with a corpse in their house and in shock and unsure what to do Have some compassion instead of being ready to beat someone down all the time Downvote me if you want but I believe this is more likely real than not|0
Trump buying the rights to coronavirus vaccine is like those assholes hoarding all the hand sanitizers  TP to sell online at a super inflated price|1

Is it frustrating looking back to  all of the warning you did and see governments around the world do nothing Do you think we will be more prepared for the next pandemic or will governments still fail to make the necessary steps to prepare|0
With a 4 fatality probably less than 1 for young and fit folks and health and safety standards I doubt this will even really get to h1n1 levels If it does it will probably be similar For reference the common flu kills thousands in America every year 100000 worldwide|0
I can not believe a 12 asymptomatic number for a second I think the princess is a decent example kuz everyone was tested Even then they were generally older so their immune systems weaker and are less likely to fight off viruses before symptoms I think it is probably even higher than 50 We cant say for sure in the general public since asymptomatic people are super likely not to be tested but south Koreas death rate shows heavy correlation between number of tests executed and lower death rates The media is so frustrating in all this even reputable sources like the times or bbc Publish articles with incomplete stats|0
Should actually be charged for this|0
Plus that opinion article is like oh its from laborers yeah so Where is the proof they didnt get it in the US|1
Agree with the limitations of this study That said its part of a trickle of studies China France a few people in Australia that point in the same direction We need a larger group and unfortunately there will be plenty of opportunities to get that If I recall some studies are randomized by using controls from before the drug was developed Maybe we could do the same thing here and for example compare early patients that only get supportive care with a larger sample of patients receiving chloroquine  Im hoping that someone is thinking along those lines because if this plays out  and that is an if  chloroquine has potential to be a prophylactic for healthcare workers too|1

It was a 70 year old man in a nursing home  oddly enough its the same owners as the nursing home in the Seattle area that had all the early deaths  He had underlying cardiac issues and was taken to the hospital with presumed cardiac problems and died there within 24 hoursSo yes a man in a nursing home did get it which means someone likely brought it to him likely visitor or staff  Delivery maybe  Which further means that its been circulating in the KC metro for some time now  Really scary as someone who lives in Wyandotte County about 5 miles from that hospital|0

I mean it seems like you dont really show any symptoms for a few days after catching it so I think this is a pretty good excuse Moreover it isnt like Americans can just take off work on a whim Is it worth it for someone who gets seasonal allergies to call out just because they have a light cough Will they lose their job Would they be unable to pay rent next month if they miss two weeks of work even without getting fired A lot of people cant take that riskDont hate the Americans that have no choice Hate the system that denies them that choice to begin withHell dont even get me started on the lack of available testing because now someone with that light cough REALLY cant know if theyre sick with COVID19 or not because they may literally have no way to find out|0
This is really irritating and saddening Its funny because back in my home country PH when the neighboring countries are imposing ban on Chinese citizens entering their countries we are all open arms and all that shit and when other countries are on the rise with the infected counts up until last week we only had 3 confirm cases Come on shit us not One private company release an official statement saying that one of their employee had been contracted and the whole community applauded their honesty and all that shit but guess what our every own govt was madangry because they said they should be the one to announce it And now guess what again the count has started to increase now Wow just wow|1
The most pissed off part is most of people being ignorant even now If there is some unknown virus happening at any part of the world I would like to collect information to give myself some insights instead of oh it is just a flu|0
Why is a lawyer masquerading as a journalist Where else in the world does this happen In China there are no journalists only those who are trained and approved to push the Party agenda In a series of video blogs and footage posted on Twitter and sometimes on YouTube which are both blocked in mainland ChinaAh so he may not be breaking any other laws but he is certainly breaking that one Mr Chen documented the plight of patients and the shortage of hospital supplies and he warned of crossinfection in Wuhans mass quarantine sitesWhy He is not representing them in any case hes actually just invading their privacy so why is he documenting them in his capacity as a lawyer Is he a medical lawyer  then what are his qualifications to determine matters of public health and safety  Mr Xu said that Mr Chens parents had been told that their son had been quarantined because he had visited several hospitals and risked contracting the virusSo on one hand he criticises the government  maintaining that the quarantine sites are likely to spread infections  but on the other hand he believes he is immune to contracting the same infections when he visits the quarantine and medical sites himself Mr Chen made headlines last summer when he visited Hong Kong to report on the citys antigovernment demonstrations and challenged portrayals by Chinese state news media that the protesters were riotersOh more case lawyer work I see Not a journalist at all he said|1

If you can isolate antibodies specific to this virus find their antigen or antigens might be antibodies for different sites on the virus rather than just one you can make a vaccine that contains just enough of the virus probably part or parts of the spike protein to generate those antibodies the antigen itself plus some surrounding protein to keep the antigen region identicalThis can wont always get a safer vaccine than live attenuated virus or whole killed virus WKV though its much harder to do while still getting the protective effect you need from the vaccine You have to find the right parts of the protein for the response you want take enough that the relevant structure is unchanged and avoid any new side effects since a fragment of the spike protein might have its own biological effects The full genome of this virus is known there are many variants genetically since it picks up a single base mutation every couple weekshttpvirologicalorgtphylodynamicanalysis176genomes6mar2020356 but it has a large genome so those mutations wont necessarily be in the part responsible for the antigen So we can take the genetic code for the part or parts of the proteins we want to make splice them into some bacteria and let those bacteria produce them for usOne of the challenges early on in the SARS vaccine attemptshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed16035944 even if they just injected the whole spike protein instead of WKV there was a substantial harmful immune response  This is also why its common to get flulike symptoms for a little while after getting a flu shot a big chunk of flu like symptoms are just part of your immune system responding to a foreign agent|1

Do you only see the world in black and white The Chinese governments wrongdoings do not invalidate the good that these individual doctors are doing I think thats whats being celebrated here|1
You really think so Sure China could have done more at the beginning Sure China lied through its teeth Sure China suppressed information But seriously NONE of that was a surprise to anyone whos spent a significant time to China The signal for you to start at least considering this might be a big issue was when it was a rummourTaiwan and South Korea knew what was up and acted accordingly Im surprised that everyone else was caught flat footed You make so much business with China and China is such a huge part of your political and strategic considerations and you have no ONE guy in your team that could have told you this might be nothing butThe reality is a lot governments didnt want to be seen as over reacting or turning off the economic spigot China been transparent or not wouldnt have helped much|1

I heard the same bullshit just not as prevalent due to reduced social media with swine flu MERS and for what its worth SARSYoull be fine You might have a 100k medical bill if you live in America at the end of it if youre unlucky but thats your own voting coming back to bite you Pretty much all new cases in the first world from soon after this post will be caught early due to the sheer hysteria and treated appropriately in 1st class hospitalsBad luck if youre old or otherwise immunosuppressed medicine can only do so much|1
Herd immunityYesterday I saw somebody did a maths about it He counted the number of ICU beds in UK and assume that is for the serious cases He then use the serious case number and the serious case rate to calculate the daily infected number Finally he got a numberIf everyday that many people get infected UKs medical system can still handle itOf course this calculation is flawed it assume that every patient who went into the ICU recovers the next day But whateverIt still takes more than 70000 days to get 100 herd immunity The time can get shorter but you might lose your beloved one before their time|0

Where do you think unemployment comes from lol Copy pasting my comment from another thread on the same topicAlso worth adding it wont cost the government THAT much money since Danes already have universal paid unemployment as well Of course that is lower than 75 maximum 4000 a month wageBut if someone were to get unemployed the government pays 2000 in unemployment each month and probably will for longer until you find a new job than these 4000 a month until Corona is overSo both do people get to keep their jobs which is good for literally everyone it wont even be that big a financial hit on the government overall|0

How does it feel to be so stupid you dont know how stupid you are  When they isolated people on the Japanese cruise shit it caused more infections than it prevented  It was viewed as a mistake  Trump specifically said he didnt want them off the ship because it would increase the number of cases|0

This is using RTPCR of throat swabs which while what China had been using we already know is an inferior test compared to nasopharyngeal samples which is part of recommended CDC testing Nasopharyngeal sample PCR was superior to CT in another recent study Positive predictive value of CT will be poor outside of an established epidemic as well|1
Youre saying reported numbers in the UK are too low The NHS started testing people and contacts of people very early on they did a lot of testing Our growth rate has been slower than other countries so far They are lagging  behind   now though to focus on hospitals which Im not sure is the correct callI think there are problems but I dont think reported numbers of cases is one of them especially as theyve estimated the true cases to be 50000 currently anyway so they are well aware and this is not due to a lack of testing this is true for almost every European country|1
Yes but you dont get one if you dont need it virus or not Getting tested doesnt change your treatment it changes how you should behave in regards to quarantining yourself|1

Also comes up on a few UK sites but not sure which ones clear auto modGoogle translateNorth Korean sources said Tuesday that officials who had been quarantined for the new coronavirus precautions in northern North Korea were shot in secret for secretly going to public facilitiesAccording to multiple sources North Korea blocked the border last month and ordered that people who had previously been to China or had been in contact with the Chinese unconditionally quarantine for a full time In particular President Kim Jongun ordered that he would rule by military law against any unauthorized departure from the designated area during the quarantine period A trade official who was quarantined after traveling to China secretly visited a public bath earlier this month was caught arrested and immediately shot They also said they knew that a senior official of the National Security Agency who had hidden his visit to China in North Pyongan was recently demoted to a farm|0

Gives them time to ramp up production  Not everything comes from China and I Sure theyve upped production of TP I guess we can follow the flow line all the way to some country or whatever and determine when TP will run out I Both pathways predict what upping production means and its ultimate affect on price If you want We are talking about essentials here Food so people can eat The delay gives enough time for supply to meet demand I guess we can do the math if you like You do all the heavy lifting and Ill make a counter argument  And we can go back and forth about details numbers and everything broken down in math The thing is your ethics You will take the last loaf of bread with a single mother behind you and I wont thats the distinction Or we can do the math and get right back to ethics Then Ill prove it mathematically if I must With proper ramp up and limitations much more people will have essentials  it just means each get a bit less to help out of fellow American|0

that and the french doctors usually recommend coke with the bubbles shaken out to help with the stomachflu like symptoms seems to be a cheap almost replacement of your pedialyte thyme herbal tea with honey for the sore throat dry coughs and things like vicks vaporub to help breathing And the italian traditionally drink lots of very sweet black tea considered to help with the diarrhea If you get stomach aches a hot bottles on the stomach often helpsso pile up on those and easy to prepare foods for when youre drained of energy all good thing to have at home anyhoweta  in the possibility of regular quarantines to deal with COVID19 outbreaks starting a small garden  even if only herbs on the kitchen window sill is a good idea to have fresh produce at hand to provide vitamins when you cant go out or simply add a pinch of taste and freshness to a ramen soup|1

Please avoid offtopic political discussionsOur policy on political posts is as followsThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion we therefore wish to limit it The line is inevitably blurred but we use a distinction between policy and politics Policy is fine politics is better posted elsewhere News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy they will be removed Likewise editorialized headlines whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned|1

Correct me if im wrongbut when someone uses the argument that the seasonal flu kills way more people than COVID19 arent they completely ignoring the fact that season flu kills only 1 percent of those affected and COVID 19 is killing close to 3  The only reason that the number of deaths from the seasonal flu is so much high because there are WAAAAAAY more cases of it  Therefore the reason for concern is simply to limit the spread of the much much deadlier virusI mean to me this is just basic statistics and isnt that hard to understand  But I may be missing something so if so please correct me|0

  In other words rural republican areas Its also important to point out that old people go to sit in a big building together 23 times a week and swap germs while singing songs about how much they love jesus I got sick a lot as a kid on tuesdays and wednesdays which is the 23 days incubation period of influenza Old people also go to other social clubs have game nights with each other which involve swapping around cardschipstiles and dont wash their hands or cover their mouths when they cough Im not happy with it either especially because the poorest ones with fixed income who are on the catfood diets are the ones who are going to be hardest hit The nasty vindictive rich ones will be in the hospitals and private clinics using up all of the ventilators as the poor ones drown in their own fluids from pneumonia|0

To put this in context Italys annual mortality rate is 10403 deaths per 1000 people or about 1 Their current population is 6048 millionAs such we expect about 1 of 60 million or 600K deaths a year The current 631 dead is about 01 of the total annual number of deaths Or put another way 1 out of 1000 deaths could be attributed to coronavirusThat would put the effect about equal to the effect of hepatitis C or melanoma or the category of upper respiratory infections Interestingly the category of lower respiratory infections is one of the highest ranking categories at 681 of all deaths which shows how dangerous this sort of thing can behttpsenwikipediaorgwikiListofcausesofdeathbyrateByfrequency|0

The corporation suing should be counter sued for price gauging during a crisis against humanity Besides the price gauging they couldnt even deliver so they should be sued for negligence too|0
It seems to take about 3 weeks before people start to die and I believe that most of the infected outside of china tend to be younger and healthier travelers and are not exactly representative of the full population yet Between these two things theres plenty of time for the numbers to come back in line|0
Los Angeles CA  Wednesday everything was normal We did a bit more shopping at a Sprouts in Pasadena for food in case there is a quarantine There was full stock of water canned food toilet paper etc Still no hand sanitizer despite a restock the day before and I didnt bother to look if they had disinfecting wipes Thursday I walk into the DTLA Target to pick up my order of tissues and flu medicine and its hectic Lots of people buying bottled water toilet paper tissues I spot a couple carts full of dry goods almost all the cold and flu medicine is gone and a lot of people are wearing masks The employees I saw were wearing gloves Whole Foods was worse The lines were crazy I wanted to get another box of pasta All the pasta was gone No beans no sauce no canned soup no canned beans and absolutely no water Cashier said they ran out of pasta two days ago Other than that people are still going out to eat and getting coffee and not that much mask wearing on pedestrians I think people who are waiting to set foot in a grocery store this weekend are going to be in for a shock|0

Im preparing for the best but Im not fearmongering the worst Thats the difference I acknowledge objective facts The stats still say so far that the most at risk populations are immunocompromised and geriatric People under 4050 just arent dying Those are the cold hard facts However I am deeply worried about the state of our older generations and the inevitable vacuum that will be caused by loosing those wealths of wisdom and knowledge|1
Are we only testing people who travelled and have close contact Is this why there are no community spread cases cause we are not testing them|0

This kind of attitude reminds me of films from the 80s like Jaws and Piranha  Always the same the scientist and the pretty lady try to alert everyone of the danger the mayor and the businessman threaten them with jail because of a huge holiday festival high season that makes loads of money from tourists  At least in the movies the piranha eats the mayor despite the scientist trying to save him in the last moment|1

Not to menton most cant get off work so they just say fuck it to everything elseThis is meHere in australia even though our govt is taking it seriously I still have to cram like a sardine into a train with hundreds of people everyday to get to work And masks have been sold out for months they were sold out due to the bushfire crisis before covid19 even existing so even if I wanted to wear one I cant get anySo really until the govt cancels public transport theres no point in me changing anything because Im being massively exposed everyday no matter whatThe only thing Im doing differently is washing my hands more|0

This is the dumbest analogy Ive ever heard even ignoring that football games doing involve protecting the public Its more likeA professional football player had 10 years to make sure he had professional pads for this months games He didnt even when he had two months of nonstop news that there might be a pad shortage There were ample pads to buy He did nothing His entire team did nothing Jim has a condition that makes his bones easily breakable He could get fired if he doesnt attend a work event that might get him pushed around by a big crowd He knew this situation could happen one day so he bought some pads long ago when there were no pad shortages He bought some extra several months ago because of the news There were still many pads to buy but they were a bit more expensive According to your stupid analogy Jim is a glass boned asshole for wearing his pads to the event The pushing and broke bones hell possibly endure are nothing compared to a pro game with tackling If Jim were a good citizen hed go to his risky work event with zero protection He would proclaim loudly that pads dont work and only professional players need them|0

The virus via aerosol will travel up only in the sense of normal air flow If everyone walking past open windows was infected and if they passed right next to the windows and there was a steady stream of people walking past then it could increase your chances of being infected yourself But the likelihood of such a scenario is low I doubt anyone living on the second floor would have much to worry about The outside air coming in would be very mixed The air breathed out by any persons walking about a court would be so diluted as to not be a concernRemember the air directly breathed out wouldnt all be sucked into your place but be moving about and only a small amount would enter unless there was a stronger breeze blowing right into open windows Remember too the higher outside relative humidity will inactivate viruses Ive never seen a study yet comparing what percentage of viruses are inactivated at what percentage relative humidity and how long it takes  though I am on the lookout for oneMy suggestion is to open windows at such times the least amount of people are walking past Do so several times a day if possible and in the night if youre up for while|0

I read people who live together can walk together  Otherwise no|0
Awesome Congrats to that man We need more like him|1
So tired of the antihand washing people My roommate is one of them So because your own fecal matter doesnt affect you you think other people should have to ingest it And because you may not get infected you think its okay to not wash your hands and spread it to people who have compromised immune systems or increased risk His response is typically good we need less people on earth Coming from someone who had 2 planned children and lets them litter|1
He promised he wont sell your data for financial gains like the last time|1
It is a big difference between will not offer full protection vs will not protect you at allOne important thing about Covid19 is how much virus an infected got in contact with will affect how sick one will be the more  the worse and shorter incubation time  That and how old the person isWorking a long time in a hospital whose air is thick with Corona and even a 29 year old doctor can get so sick that he diesHopefully the reason they put this up so that hospitals has enough masks left that I can respectIn worst case it is to uphold the facade there is nothing here to see  be happy and please buy more stock so I can get reelected  Trump|0

Shortterm benefit of lisinopril in wellcontrolled diabetes is not too big No idea what the NNT of such patients with lisinopril would be to prevent an event from occurring equal in magnitude to like dying from ARDS If being on an ACEARB increases your chance of dying from ARDS by 10 thats probably a greater good than the harm caused by maybe slightly worsened diabetic nephropathy occurring as a result over that time period The same analyses should be done for its other indicationsSounds like NIH will be giving us our first real data in this regard within the week If theres even a small benefit from going off these given the overall shitstorm were potentially looking at thats probably a big net win Stay tuned|1

Notwithstanding there is still no way they can bring back manufacturing Consumers will never adjust to that kind of prices small businesses will close sales will drop and a ton of companies will become unprofitable unless they reduce costs but they cant fire people cmso what will they doAlso more jobs are lost by automation than offshoring Look at the new self service counters in Walmart Didnt college kids lose their shifts because of that Are we supposed to not do that as well for the good of society|1

This will vary a lot by country China is seeing very few cases now because their testing and shut down was very effective If a country does a good job with testing and shut down then within 610 weeks they should see very few cases and be able to open back up|1
I think Italy will do better than US Italy has  strong community sense and will pull up their efforts US will just go to work while sick and the virus will be just circling all year long|1
Weve put hand sanitizers in the bathrooms at work and put bigger things of disinfecting wipes around the office but Ive heard nothing about any potential workfromhome plans or anything else Meanwhile there are people coughing constantly and guys wash their hands in the bathroom for two seconds Everything is business as usual because my state has no confirmed cases yet but Im trying to mentally prepare for the upcoming weeks and my anxiety is a bit high Im pretty young and healthy but I still worry about potentially spreading anything to anybody else|1

It takes about two weeks before symptoms get severe so some people might not have known they had it before it took a turn for the worse|0
While that is true for the 80 of less severe cases obviously the very ill will check themselves in for treatment when they have trouble breathing And 20 require intense treatmentHaving affordable medical treatment could have meant screening more effectively instead people just pretend they arent sick until its too late|1

tedros is a disgusting failure in life idk how he even became who secretary general in the first placeits very obvious that this virus is out of control as seen in how south korea iran and italy suddenly had so many cases in such a short period of timeand dont forget he delayed calling the  outbreak a matter of global concern despite many others already stating that china is definitely underdeclaring the number of cases|0
Probably the most unrealistic thing about Contagion is the idea that a virus could be transmitted around the world when it kills people so quickly People get infected and die within 23 days Theres no time for them to spread it around before they keel over|0

Thanks thats what i wanted to hear from a credible source nonetheless Information on the internet is such a mess right now|1
Also in The Netherlands the stupidity of Boris has reached Dutch shores|0
But if its super urgent like currently we are staring down at some pretty scary numbers would it shorten the testing phase Like if China was doing their drug test and they say it would be ready April or something can we just be like yah it didnt kill the Chinese so we will use it too Or does it have to be tested here for the FDA to approve|1
Ah yes by that logic we should burn down the school to be safe|1

I dont want to jerk myself off but this was my gut reaction back when we saw the German cases It made zero sense to me that we had like 6 people exhibiting no substantial symptoms and meanwhile it was 28 Days Later in Wuhan This sounds like a prevalence problem instead of a severity problemFlipside is that there is a 0 chance that this disease is containable and the public needs to be more diligent than ever with disease prevention|1

I live with three type 2 diabetics While the virus is in our city there arent many cases yet and Id like to know what measures I can take to keep them safe if there are any beyond washing hands keeping your distance from sick people and staying away from large gatherings If they contract the illness should they go to the hospital right away instead of trying to deal with it at home|0
Yeah but not as bad as I thought either|1
Thats so awesome to hearIm honestly surprised that this isnt the reaction of everyone on this post who is lucky enough to be replied to  I mean if I ran into Bill Gates on the street I wouldnt be able to hold myself together so why should this be any different|1
People are calling into LBC saying we should all let ourselves become infected to build up the heard immunityOne caller just said he had heard of people having coronavirus parties to all get infected like with chicken poxWhy has everyone suddenly turned into a high stakes gamblerTheyre genuinely willing risk a 110  120 chance of being hospitalisedWould you put your hand in a lucky dip of 100 balls and if you pick the 1 black ball you dieSomething very dark and strange is going in in the UK compared to other countriesIts so odd its making me feel sick|0

A good way to phrase it if you decide to talk to your grandparents again is that taking small measures now like stocking up on sanitary gels gloves and other basic medical supplies are useful to have in general in case of any emergency   One of the key factors that affect the spread of illness during a epidemic is whether or not people take it seriously and take the necessary precautions at the right time By the time the illness is visible enough that everyone starts wearing masks a significant portion of the population will have already been infected  I personally dont think the virus will affect most European countries too severely but at the moment no one knows enough to do anything other than speculate   So in the meantime Im gonna be stocking up on basic necessities If things were to get worse the last thing you want to be doing is rushing around the shops panicbuying supplies among crowds of people Even if its unnecessary panic because of media hype Id rather do my food shop without the chaos P|0
I think one of the reasons people are panicking is so much is because everything is shutting down The logic is something like all of the leaders in the world would not be doing this unless it were very serious There is also the question of how this is going to affect us all economically and politically Im not trying to reinject panic just explain what Ive heard from others|0
 Those who were on the Diamond Princess Cruise who contracted COVID19 may represent a best case scenario where they were treated as early as possible and therefore their outcomes may be better than those who identify COVID19 later  They also have the benefit of ventilators and ECMO Depending on the speed of the spread of the pandemic neither of those will be available in large enough numbers to make a significant difference in the death toll|1

My friend is a nurse at a major hospitalresearch center in the US where weve already had positive cases This is what they found out this morningThey arent even testing nurses that were exposed to a patient that tested positive and are now showing symptoms She doesnt meet the criteria to be tested because she doesnt need hospitalized Never mind her family or patients she could have exposedIts getting criminal at this point Obviously its just word of mouth and Im a stranger on the internet so take that for what its worth but thats the text I got from my friend this morning|1

Taiwan South Korea Vietnam plenty of countries took charge and their citizens will weather the pandemic far better Vietnam is making care packages of food for those quarantined even special food for Korean visitors that are not used to Vietnamese food Their quick response means they have very few infected Makes a big difference if you live in a country that practices collectivism over individualism and doesnt have a government completely corrupted by profit|1

I saw a local hospital worker complaining about exactly this situation  That person was saying they are not allowed to wear masks unless the patient has tested positive  Of course they know that by then theyre already infected  Seems to be either some archaic policy or government bs  The more I pay attention the more concerned Ive become at how this thing is going to play out|1

Yup thats whats happening And we absolutely are going to obsess over it Thats how we track the life of the virus  Im disappointed in Trump too but blaming others for wanting to be prepared is counter productive Blame the availability of supplies and lack of emergency preparedness in a worldwide pandemic lack of PPE lack of appropriate dissemination of information needed to identify precautions and preventative measures on the systems or lack thereof we have and depend on ie keep calm dont panic until we have to panic The sick and elderly are absolutely at risk and this is why the non sick and elderly are stocking up and preparing to socially isolate Because we dont want to expose ourselves and therefore others|0

Population genetic analyses of 103 SARSCoV2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated L and S that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date Although the L type 70 is more prevalent than the S type 30 the S type was found to be the ancestral version Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020 Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type which might be more aggressive and spread more quicklyOn the other hand the S type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure|0

Your numbers are wrong and your data is wrong Its no surprise you wont cite your sources The predictive model you refer to does say up to 70 could be infected But thats in a sixteen month timeframe And thats if little is done to mitigate spread But weve started taking drastic measures already so even that scenario should be avoidable|0

I live in New York I was talking to my doctor of 20 years about this for like 15 minutes tonight He said to me frankly we are all going to have the Coronavirus soon When he said that he had no emotion in his voice and he sounded bored talking about it He said it will be mild for most of the people catching it He said if people are unhealthy or older they will be the ones having the most problems I was assured it is basically nothing to worry about I was scared and he kept reassuring me I would be fine Maybe he was blowing smoke up my assWhat he did say is the hospital on Long Island NY he works at is insanely crazy right now He said it was getting really busy there with people panicking over flu symptoms He admitted to me that in another 23 weeks the shit is really going to hit the fan at most of the hospitals across the USA He also said that once they test for the Coronavirus it is usually way too late because the person already had it for some time He said being tested for it and finding out you are positive does nothing for you health wise as there is no cure for it He said by the time you end up finally getting tested you already infected a shit load of people tooHe did not seem alarmed or worried at all He didnt even sound like he thought testing was important because we are all going to get it apparently I actually think he was way too nonnonchalant about the whole thing Maybe he is burnt out already I dont feel very confident in our doctors right now|1

This is a Chinese paper heres a rough summaryMethod 134 Shanghai patients diagnosed with nCoV 69 males 65 females 52 patients took lopinavir and ritonavir HIV inhibitors used in MERS outbreak 34 were treated with Ardibol Umifenovir  an antiviral medication used in SARS outbreak while the remaining 48 patients used neither mediation control Treatment time was 5 days for both methods after diagnosis in order to measure effectiveness in treatments This was measured using both nucleic acid samples along with bilateral lung CT scans after 7 daysx200BResults Both treatments showed similar viral load levels with the control showing no significant difference to the 2 treatment methods Clearance of symptoms between all 3 methods was not significantly different 17 of lopinavir and ritonavir patients exhibited nausea and diarrhea this is a common side effect found in people who use HIV inhibitors Two patients in each of the three treatments 6 in total were found to have liver damage this is interesting as nCoV possibly binds to ACE2 liver receptors which may explain this Two patients 1 in control 1 in medication treatment had an elevated level of white blood cells which is a possible indicator that the patients were reinfected with nCoVx200BDrawbacks of the study A majority of patients only exhibited regular pneumonia not severe accompanied with fever and cough This means that severe patients were not included in the study Nucleic acid tests were only done on the 7th day after diagnosis and that 14day tests need to be undertaken in future tests to get a sufficient analysis on medication      effectiveness Pharyngeal swabs were not collected daily therefore it is not possible to accurately determine the pathogenic negative time of respiratory specimens and the medications      antiviral effect There is no relevant dosage of each medication meaning that more clinical tests are needed in order to find the optimal dosage as of now dosages are in the experimental      stage|0

CDC does modeling to determine the burden upon the population How they do it an be found here httpswwwcdcgovfluaboutburdenindexhtmlhttpswwwcdcgovfluaboutburdenindexhtmlThere is not enough known about Covid 19 to do this AND influenza is based upon a relatively highly vaccinated population but then again each year the vaccine is different in terms of its effectiveness The worst year recently 201718 season was estimated at 45 million with a large range and an estimated roughly 7 million cases not occurring because of vaccine  The diagnosed confirmed and reported was substantially less So it was a bad year for the variant and a bad year for the vaccine This is why it is so important to understand prevalence as in the burden of disease that is a function of diagnosed tested and reported AND all those cases that are asymptomatic subclinical or mild  AND it appears there is data that individuals may be able to transmit prior to having symptoms  The CDC Covid 19 publications page is locatable here httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovpublicationshtmlhttpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovpublicationshtml|0

For the sake of a debate can anyone explain simple terms why we need to keep testing people apart from the desire to collect more statistics What Boris stated with regards to testing is simple to understand In his words we know the virus is in the country and is spreading therefore there is no need to test people to know that the virus is here The maths based on already gathered statistics from other countries allows us to predict how fast it will spread throughout the community without having to gather our own evidence on numbers of infectedGetting tested for something is only useful if it results in a change of action Finding out if you have coronavirus does not change anything unless it results in a a different course action If you are tested and found to have coronavirus you will be asked stay home and selfisolate unless your condition gets severe enough for hospital The advice that is being given by the government is that anyone with symptoms should self isolate tested or not Therefore there is no difference in actions whether the infected are tested or not|0

Monetizing technology advances by exporting them to the US is Koreas bread and butter Obviously theyre not asking for money now but if this proves effective it will position them as a supplier for yearsPolitically Korea is also strongly allied with the US both in terms of trade and the military alliance protecting against North KoreaStill a great thing that theyre doing just pointing out that its not as simple as them thinking does US really deserve help right now when making these decisions|1

Thank you|1
To put it in perspective  Im a nurse We are caring for Covid19 patients We have very few n 95 masks which is what the CDC recommends for caring for these patients and have been told to use surgical masks WTF Think about this I understand grocery store and pharmacy employees are being potentially exposed to these infected people  but Im in direct contact with confirmed cases and using substandard protection  but whos going to take care of YOUR ass when you get sick Complaining isnt going to help anything It would be great to receive hazard pay but it is what it is I pray I dont pass this on to my 85 yr old Dad who is now living with us Stay home and wash your hands PLEASE|1

its certainly cold enough in australias winter for flu to spread the fact that its not snowing doesnt make it warm plus even if it just takes the edge off that still makes a difference its better if it infects everyone with an R0 of 13 than if it infects everyone with an R0 of 13 since our hospitals will be in better shape|1

But mentally unwell people can mean someone with paranoia or something similar And those people are not stupid but because of their defective functioning can still make very stupid decisions and fail to recognize or truly believe what is true and what is false This of course wont make them stupid but it may seem so that they areI think this is what the other redditor tried to say Unstable people wont listen to reason sometimes even if they can deduce the truth logically so feeding them false information can be very dangerous|1

This isnt going to work either way the virus remains highly contagious but asymptomatic and undetectable without a test for 24 weeks Telling people to stay home when they feel sick is too late they will have already been spreading it for weeks We needed mass testing but now it is really too late The virus is likely now endemic to America and we should prepare for the exponential growth of cases for months to come|0

Im only interested in confirmed information I was mostly on Chinaflu before the switch when they made it I moved here I understand that the mods have to walk a pretty delicate line sometimes Theyve been better todaythis evening then they were yesterdaythis morning I think its completely reasonable at this point to say that we have confirmed information which will make some people feel hysterical Its not my response but the numbers say a lot of people might die in the next six months people should be prepared for that in order to minimize the suffering and loss|0
Bear in mind that you wont die for sure even if you do have bad asthma  Far from it in fact  You cite a 5 death rate among respiratory condition sufferers such as yourself but on the flip side that is a 95 survival rate  You have age on your side too dont forgetI know its easier said than done but staying as relaxed as you can and getting plenty of sleep is one of the best things you can do as it will help keep your immune system strong  Daily Multivit supplements could be a good idea on this front too especially if you feel theres a chance that your diet will be lacking some of theseMaybe just see if you can sit your husband down for a proper chat about it and reinforce how important this is to you  I saw that youd mentioned hes an engineer at the school which may help him limit his exposure a bit to start with  There is nothing wrong with voicing concerns about this to an employer and even if theyre not telling him I bet a good few of his colleagues are doing so aswell|1
I did not But I read the article He said there could be 100000 cases of CoronaVirus in the US right now Lol|1

2 of my grandkids had both Flus different states and no contact with each other and RSV  This was from Christmas until Valentines in the US  So the flu season does seem to be especially bad this year  It makes me wonder if there are lots of cases with people having both flus so theyre just assuming thats what it is  Besides the fact that there just arent tests available  One of my grandkids even had a relapse that really mimicked the symptoms extremely high fever dry cough but was refused testing  This was 2 weeks ago  A case was found in their county a few days later|0

Are there 7 billion masks Are there 3 billion masks This virus is here for at least a bit longer than a month So how many masks is that Over the course of this entire pandemic how many masks will a single individual need to wear daily  Then multiply that by at least 3 billion in a western society add the other 4 billion people with less access if you will  So do we have enough masks to run around telling everybody that they need to wear them Is that effective Because if not then if we give all the masks to the healthy person with anxiety problem combined with a hording personality then you are taking masks away from sick individuals Masks are more effective at preventing a sick person from spreading the virus then it is to stop a random asshole from contracting the virus Hell half you people take the mask off and wear it around your neck all day until you feel like putting it on  So when you buy all the masks and leave now for healthcare workers or sick people then they are not effective sitting around the neck of a healthy asshole You guys do you though because your fucked in the head|0

i read a similar report done by some doctors in japan they said the drug appears to prevent the virus from essentially overtaking healthy cells thus treating the patient and shortening the duration of the disease overall they also said it appears to lessen symptoms in severe casesedit the report in question never actually reached a hypothesis on why the drug works just that it does seem to work make sure to check out the report and read it for urself it can explain far better and more accurately than i ever could|1

Canada is still recommending that healthy people should not wear maskshttpswwwcanadacaenpublichealthservicesdiseases2019novelcoronavirusinfectionpreventionriskshtmlwm I dont understand this at all Wearing masksIf you are a healthy individual the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID19 Wearing a mask when you are not ill may give a false sense of security There is a potential risk of infection with improper mask use and disposal They also need to be changed frequently However your health care provider may recommend you wear a mask if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID19 while you are seeking or waiting for care In this instance masks are an appropriate part of infection prevention and control measures The mask acts as a barrier and helps stop the tiny droplets from spreading you when you cough or sneeze|1

Yes dont go to an ER unless youre having severecritical symptomsAll of the urgent cares said that youll only be tested for COVID19 right now if your symptoms are critical amongst other qualifiersand therefore justify you to be at the ER anywayIf youre just sick but not dangerously sick call your doctors office or an urgent careTheyll probably just have you get tested for flu and thats it for now|0

Im not sure why no one is hearing me If she leaves the school she will not be able to return They are not letting anyone enter the school from the outside at this point Someone came from the government yesterday to inspect and take temps and they refused to even let them enter If her flight or connecting flights get grounded or cancelled for ANY reason she will be on the street alone with no where to go I can not in good conscience tell her to leave a place where she has a roof over her head and 3 meals a day if its even remotely possible that her flights wont get out Yes I understand this may devolve into an apocalyptic every man for himself scenario In fact any nightmarish scenario that you can think of I promise you I have not only already thought of but also have repeated to her over and over in the last week and a half I have sent every option and every flight out to not only the US but every surrounding country to her over the last 10 days The reality is that she waited too long to comprehend the seriousness even with all my warnings and pleading and now she is stuck If I knew she would get the virus but also that she would be able to fly out both with 100 certainty I would absolutely tell her to go to the airport right now Being homeless in a pandemic in a foreign county where she knows absolutely no one and doesnt speak the language is not a situation Im going to insist she put herself in I begged her not to go to China in the first place even before this virus was breaking news She landed in Beijing on the 13th Ive been up night and day watching this unfold since the 15th Ive been begging her to come home for nearly 2 weeks Ive been straight up telling her to GET OUT NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN for the last 5 days And since you asked no I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE if anything happens to her|0

Not new cases and not new deaths Existing cases which are being tested and deaths which likely happened a while ago which were not being put down as Coronavirus related They likely updated those numbers today This isnt a huge deal even if it does seem scary The amount of suspected cases in China dropped like a brick today too which indicates they likely were just shifting them over There is a massive backlog of cases which need to be tested in Hubei This is why the vast vast majority of the rise today came from Hubei not the rest of China They also built a huge testing lab which came operational today which likely was a big reason why the casesdeaths changed so much Just remember that the confirmed cases rising is a good thing We know the actual amount of cases is way higher so the more confirmed cases they are means that they are finally catching up with the total amount of cases|0

Im a provider working in a primary care level medical office in NYC We dont routinely break out the respirator or goggles when patients come in We do when theres a concerning travel history and fevercough but now with this case of transmission that leaves a lot of room for error The workflow in most offices is generally that someone comes in with a cough the front desk gives them a mask and asks if theyve been traveling if no then please have a seat and someone will be with you in a minute Its flu season and its much more likely for someone to have flu or pneumonia than COVID19 and I only have rapid test kits for the flu Even if that comes back negative if someone has mild symptoms and can be managed at home thats usually what we do No where in that chain of events is there an overt indication to call the health department and Im worried that the lack of testing kits in office means a lot of mild cases ie not requiring hospitalization we be missed this way We see 10 patients like this a day at my practice and were one of hundreds probably thousands in NYC With PPE stock issues its totally unrealistic to break out a new set of goggles and N95 mask for every single patient who comes in with a fever|0

Lmao Im literally saying what has been happening for more than two months Does anyone here have any inkling of critical thinking ability Does anyone not find it strange that out of tens of thousands of confirmed cases this virus just does not seem to do anything to nonChineseAsian people I mean even Indian students who were at ground zero of the outbreak in Wuhan They just got evacuated and not one of 600 students have the virus What about the American evac UK evac Even Russian Evac Diplomats business people teachers students out of all the thousands evacuated from ground zero of the outbreak not a single nonAsian seems to be seriously effectedAnd what about all the cases of spreading within nonAsian countries The common flu or cold would have caused more damage 10 germans were diagnosed and then almost instantly recovered from the virusThe extraordinary claim here isnt what Im observing The extraordinary claim here would be that this virus can spread at all in nonAsian countries to nonAsian people This thing is ravaging China and spreads like a plague even in areas that arent medically overwhelmed yet not a single case in the whole wide world even from those evacuated from Wuhan of any nonAsians being seriously effected by this virusI understand Im wasting my time here talking to you if you are one of those retards that needs an authority figure to confirm that the sun does indeed rise and set every day|0

Everyone in Italy has a certain amount of paid leave hours that we gain month by month and set aside We use those for holidays or when we need time off it can be days or it can be an hour to take your car to the mechanic stuff like that Now they are asking us to use those hours and stay at home if we can Every employer has to decide if they can put people on leave and who those people are For example I am a field tech for a industrial equipment company and as I usually work internationally Im currently nearly useless therefore my company made a schedule where me and my colleagues will take paid leave in turns Im currently at homeOf course some companies will decide that they can put many on leave and some will put none As it is with countries those with healthier finances can afford more radical measures This will damage our economy its unavoidable unfortunately but the alternative is more deaths|1

x200BWhen I was hospitalized for a month in a Long Island NY burn unit I was in isolation to protect me from germs The 30 days I spent there not one person came in and cleaned my room except for a janitor lady that would stop by every couple of days to mop the floor in my room and empty my garbage cans The counter tops were filthy my bathroom was filthy and I had to request clean sheets everyday and changed my own sheets If I didnt change my own sheets nobody would have unless I made a stink about it because they were so understaffedI felt as though I was in a hospital in a third world country  The doctors acted like rockstar divas and the nurses were busting their asses running to help patients nonstop without much help I ended up getting high fevers and infections every single time I had a skin graft operation and had to keep getting the surgeries done over and over I never seen a hospital room so filthy before I could not believe they couldnt figure out why I was catching infections SMH|1
So how would this work  For example if there is a press conference tomorrow Monday  would they say effective immediately or would the say effective tomorrow  I think if you give people too much advanced notice there will be chaos but there has to be some sort of notice  right I do feel like there will be some sort of announcement tomorrow|1

Quite possibly Ive never looked at any statistics But personally I wouldnt trust thoseSee when you graduate from school you need to get this document from the school nurse about your history of vaccination which Id done It says Id gotten my flu shots every year without fail even though Im certain I havent done them since 4th or 5th grade Mostly because I usually catch colds around September which is when vaccination takes place|0
 The tests are free for people who have symptoms or contact with an infected patient and otherwise cost around 130 If an individual tests positive for the coronavirus infection the government covers all costs for hospitalization and treatment and even provides compensation for living expenses while in selfquarantine   Maybe not mandatory but they have incentive to sit at home and Reddit  Theyre setting the example we need to follow so yeah almost trust them more at this point|1

Perhaps the US will cut back on war spending and invest in the wellbeing of its society you know universal healthcare education unemployment insurance reduced poverty and less violence This is what all the other G7 nations and the 1215 nations that are ranked above the USA for quality of life have done You folks are going to pay for the money above society that your 1 has pushed so very hard as democracy when its capitalism  Note I am not a communist nor a socialist but the numbers demonstrate that when a country takes care of its citizens everyone benefits Good luck|1

The Spanish Flu was a highly unique virus in that it happened at the same time that WW1 ended sending tens of millions of soldiers home all across the world in a very short period of time The Spanish flu infected much of the world in a matter of weeks its not quite comparable to the current outbreak or really any outbreak It was also a virus which mutated to become more deadly which was due to the very unique setting of the war The current increase in cases in Japan was due to the taxi driver situation This is bad but its not 100 an indication of out of control community transmission and can mostly be contained if they are able to track down anyone who took the taxi drivers car One of the best signs we have right now are the lack of obvious transmissions cases where people were close with the infected but didnt get infected Most of the transmissions we are seeing are transmissions from family to family and while local transmission with unknown cause is happening its not even close to happening on an uncontrollable scale in singapore or japan But what is even more notable is the amount of familyfriends who were with the infected who are not getting this virus People who had dinner with the infected people who lived with the infected etc who arent getting infected themselves Obviously many are but it is notable that quite a lot of them arent Cases where the infected was in close contact with 30 people over the span of a week and not a single one of the 30 contracted the virus This goes very much against the theory that this has an astronomically high R0 and the studies which are producing those figures are attempting to use numbers and estimates out of China which might as well be conjecture The WHO even talked about this that we have to be slightly wary of studies on the virus right now as many of them are going to be preliminary varying estimates and wont be based on hard data It doesnt mean these studies are useless each one of them does have something important to say about the virus in many respects but its important to take the conclusions about R0 and death rates with a bit of a grain of salt During SARS the R0 figures varied wildly in the early weeks of the virus I was taking my epidemiology class at the exact same time as SARS and I remember learning what an R0 was then finding out two days later that SARS supposedly had an R0 of 75 based on a study SARS ended up having an R0 of 25 Anyways all of this comment might as well be conjecture if I cant find the study which went over the cases and examined the infections among those close to the infected lol I need to get back to my computer for that RemindMe 5 hours|0

This is a very good theory Im from Seattle If you took the nursing home cases out of our fatalities here in WA wed have 3 statewide not 22 Out of a total of 162 known cases of varying severity Which fits way more with the whole rocket through the populace mostly undetected as a mild flu until it occasionally runs into an elderly or person with comorbidies and explodes theory and also explains Italy|0

I disagree  This virus plays out in a matter of weeks  As of the 22nd of February they really discovered a lot of infected people  These people were likely already infected for some time  Now were almost 14 days past  So they are beginning to be more accurate  Id like to see another week or 2 but I dont think months are required  I think after a couple of months this is going to die down significantlyIf we keep on it throughout summer we can probably kill it  At the very least reduce the spread during the next season  Its all about buying time for a vaccine|0
Taken as an unmasking of previously unreported cases this isnt as concerningIm not so sure about that Were talking about cases where pneumonia has been discovered which immediately puts those cases in the severe category According to most experts only 1520 of cases progress to this stage They arent clinically diagnosing anything that would be considered mild cases only those that need immediate medical attention Id imagine at this point none of their confirmed cases are mild symptomsdiagnoses since they just added 13k people to the list that at minimum are considered severe cases I think its very concerning|0

Ill actually explain what I mean hereTheres actually multiple ways this is the casea There are insurance plans that only pay a percentage leaving you to cover a percentage  This is what youre thinking of hereb There are also insurance plansthat pay 100 up to a certain dollar limit pay nothing until a higher dollar limit and then pay a large percentage typically requiring you to cover 515 afterward  Its that SECOND one Im especially referring to and thats the Not Fun of what is referred to as the deductible donut hole by a lot of plans  Including of note most of your ACA plans some of which have rather substantial deductible holeshitting the hole sometime between 5001500 and climbing out of it sometime between 1500 and 15000 or more the latter common with ACA plans to the 515 Zone  Oh and yes its still submitted to the insurance company who helpfully sends you notices that they still wont pay Sweet F A on anything until youve had enough medical treatment and done enough payment to medical groups and pharmacies outofpocket that youre judged Now Out Of The Deductible Donut Holec Some insurance plans most notoriously HMOs but even some PPOs actually vary in what they will cover at all depending on whether the doctor or pharmacy is in network or out of network and whether the drug is in the formulary or not  New antivirals and antimicrobials in general new biopharmaceuticals and medications for orphan diseases are a particular type of Special Hell where the formulary issue and preferred pharmacological product manufacturer and preferred pharmacy issues come upYes Ive had the distinctly Not Fun experience of actually going to a doctor innetwork going to a pharmacy innetworkand finding that my insurance company is now refusing to cover maintenance meds because its not in the formulary oreven more annoyingtheyre forcing you to go with THEIR specific mailorder pharmacy ONLY for maintenance meds and will not cover the drug at any other pharmacy  Im just thankful nobody in my family has to take an orphan drug thats only available through one specific mailorder pharmacy or a very few limited and trained pharmacies due to safety concerns theyd be screwed|0

There is literally a zero percent chance that the numbers china reports are accurate Every other country has recovery rates going down due to strain on hospital system and infections spreading China magically has suddenly reversed course the numbers that they have been reporting are just TOO good it doesnt make any sense Whats more they still are suppressing actual information and witness reports from the area so theres nothing to back up what theyre saying|1

 The vast majority of nongeriatric healthy people almost certainly 95 and probably 99 that get CV19 remain subclinical dont even need a doctor much less a hospital They just get better at home and are then immuneWhere are you basing your data on this Diamond Princess South Korea and Germany arent updating their severecritical numbers|1
I mean lost hours is pretty much expected and desirable right The more people stay at home the faster we get this under wraps and get the economy back on track I know we probably need some temporary relief in the form of a check to working adults but bundling these two numbers jobs lost  and is that temporarily or permanently  with people on paid or unpaid leave or reduced hours due to reduced business hours makes this sound worse than it is Lost hours should probably be much higher We were at very low unemployment rates before this hit|0

Everywhere had low numbers until they started testing|0
True it failed the first time but this is a second chance with more info about the disease   That first attempt was back in late Jan when asymptomatic cases werent considered  They traced contacts but just asked them to report fever and respiratory problems  They werent quarantined or testedSo Im thinking its not an unknown contact its a known contact who was asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms   Tracing back from the student might be hard its several generations back but you can also go back to the first list and check them for antibodies  Or just start checking their contacts for symptoms|0

This is a very compressed timeline for a study Until we had enough patients we couldnt efficiently run studies Now as far as the CDC not having it on their treatment guidelines I cant say Id have it on as a provisional and have seen it on a cheat sheet some providers are using to treat I think the question for all antivirals is when to treat For me earlier the better as I read that the viral load is higher earlier which is when they can make the biggest difference and potentially prevent progression As some have said this is evolving rapidly and we will get the treatment piece sorted It will take some time which is not reassuring but Im confident based on what I see we will get this sorted|1

Where Im not even remotely for Medicare replacing my insurance as I have zero faith in the government to provide a little more than slightly less than private insurance  Im cynical I agree these emergency situations call for more extreme measuresBut treatment is limited to pneumonia and ARDS support neither of which require a confirmed dx of the coronavirus The biggest risk is hospitals spreading it to healthcare workers and already sick people|0

I dont even mention it to anyone now Im in the States but my family and many friends are in the UK Ive mentioned stocking up to my folks and they werent dismissive but said they always had extra food in the house anyway I just sent a long email to my dad about how abruptly Italy and Iran shut down various areas and those people may not have had chance to stock up I said if Im wrong whats the worst case scenario You just need to eat all the spare food over the next year He watches the news obsessively so I know hes aware I just dont bother mentioning it to anyone else as I hate the dismissive comments Its not a black and white situation though Im not saying were all going to get this virus Im saying it takes precious little to tip any community over the edge A case in their community and everyone will start panic buying Suddenly shelves are half empty which precipitates more panic buying Ten people get seriously ill and the local hospital is at maximum capacity Those are the things everyone should be concerned about|0
Do you have sources on this by any chance Im a university student who pretty much depends on meal plans from my school and have been very nervous about this since obviously the food isnt prepared by me The best things Ive been able to do are just washing my hands immediately before and after eating avoiding any finger foods using utensils at all times and praying that none of the staff is sick|1

Shush these comments are supposed to be for discussion on COVID19 so just leave|0
I have been studying the online comments made by people already infected and from links in this threadI work in a medical center  Onset appears to be a variety of symptoms including diarrhea sore throat stomach upset and vomiting headache weakness a general feeling of malaise joint and muscle pain headache fever and finally a nonproductive cough with chest pain Its also been reported that watery eyes could be a symptom and some patients finally had some mucus coming up While flu pneumonia bronchitis 24hour throwup bug and viral syndrome all appear to mimic these symptoms the telltale sign for testing appears to be negative outcomes to strep and flu tests with fever and a nonproductive cough This is why the government is stressing these two symptoms IMHO The problem is that we should really be testing anyone with ANY of these symptoms but we are not Additionally and more alarmingly we are freeing potential carriers back into the population once they no longer show symptoms even though as was proven in links in the above threads that reinfection may be possible if the person has merely temporarily overcome the virus I fully expect a lockdown situation is imminent but for it to be practical the country would have to shut down for 40 days Of course in America this is impossible As a result I am sure that we will be seeing deaths in this country until a vaccination is proven and distributed to most of the population Anyone ever seen The Andromeda Strain Strange parallels The one possibility and hope is that COVID19 will mutate into something harmless Lets all pray for that|0

On January 28 2020  Alex AzarOur secretary of Health and Human ServicesSaid the Trump administration had no plan to declare a public health emergency as theCOVID19 virusspread in China He said the risk to Americans is minimal though admitting that in almost 30 states authorities were monitoring potential cases continuing I wont hesitate at all to invoke any authorities I need to to ensure were taking all steps to protect the American people but Ill do it when its appropriate The outbreak began in December 2019 with the government having two months of lead time to prepare before the virus reached the continental US Azar is under criticism for not mobilizing resources quickly enough Thus Americas ability to test for the virus was hampered by both contamination and delays His sheer incompetence and disregard may have accelerated the spread of the virus|0

On the 4th of March cases were at 6000 confirmed outside of China   Predicted doubling every 3 days would have put todays total at around 1215k   Today that figure is 30k confirmed outside of China  Confirmed cases have almost quadrupled in 4 days all while Italy has been taking the massive mitigating steps of quarantining millions of peopleNowhere else is taking the steps that Italy has It looks like nowhere else will   And Italy wont be able to much longer This rate may pale into comparison|1

I feel so sorry for the average american having to deal with this shit One thing I have noticed with European healthcare is that sometimes doctors will tell you drink soup and tough it out for a lot of minor things very hesitant to prescribe anything unless its absolutely necessary and sometimes you will have to wait a month or 2 for a nonvital surgery but id much rather wait a while than be bankrupted because I broke my wrist or something And of course for really serious things you dont have to wait months|0

That makes total sense I guess the answer is that we will find out the nCoV CFR eventually   I would imagine that for risk mitigation planning purposes when looking at novel diseases  outbreak contexts there is a bias towards cautionIt would also seem that the CFR in this particular case is dependent on the level of care available to individuals In one article  foreign policycom  they stated that 2532 are admitted to ICU to maintain viable SpO2 levelsWhat would that kind of modelling look like for better studied diseases|1

How are false comparisons going to help Youre just another link in the misinformation machine thats somehow determined to spread panic and fearFirst of all the mortality rate of Covid19 is heavily skewed by countries only testing those who are already experiencing crippling symptoms like Iran and Italy All those people with just a cough or thr large majority without any symptoms at all are ignored ramping up the mortality rate China isnt helpful either when they throw patients into camps where infections run rampant exactly the type of situation one would have to avoid when you have a flu since it compromises your immune system Its no wonder that death rates start to skyrocket in those scenariosIf you want accurate numbers look at countries like Germany and the Netherlands who test everyone thats possibly been in contact with the virus even though theyre not experiencing any symptoms at all As of today only 1 German died who was visiting Egypt and yet Germany had over a thousand confirmed cases How do you explain that Care to update your little graph with that mortality rate instead Of course not that wouldnt fit your personal panicked view of this situation|0

This was needed weeks ago Now it has already spread very widely in the us only thing is they have not tested everyone 20 deaths if you take flu numbers like many are assuming means at least 20k people are already infected And each person infect about another 15 people That means the number of infected doubles every 12 days 20k infected today means 20million infected end of March Even if 1 need ICU care mean you will need 200k ICU bedsThe Spanish flu came in 2 waves the first was not as deadly the 2nd wiped out 5 of the worlds population Letting millions get infected means the chances of this virus mutating to something even deadlier goes up Politicians treating this as just another flu are idiots|0

CCP could and could afford to pay out some type of sickness quarantine relief benefit for the people under quarantine there are government sick benefits available to sick workers in Europepresumably someone banned from working not yet showing symptoms would also be covered and could probably come up with some kind of a relief scheme to hold a hand under businesses that need to be recapitalized after not being able to sell more products or services than rent costs  Outside of China most likely such measures would be not that likely done on a large scale as it would be seen as too much government interference in businesses|1

 Death and Spread ratesThe mortality rate is only about 23 It is very unlikely that you would die if you contracted the virus 100000 total cases are around the world and more than half have recovered from it  100000 isnt the total infected currently it is all time if you take that into account only 46773 people are infected right now     AsthmaExercise asthma wouldnt prove deadly if you caught the virus I heard swimming is really good and can help reduce flairups I know the last bit was a little bit off track but you should really try it It can calm down your nerves You should always get your medicine for it If you dont you are going to be in pain when you exercise x200B Dealing with stressanxietyFirst of all I feel you bud I have anxiety my self I can lose control and start to hyperventilate over the tiniest things I have educated my self on the virus to prevent flair ups on my anxiety  First of all take a second to breathe and appreciate everything you have Focus on now not what you have manifested about the future You will feel happy and stressfree You have taken your mind off of the virus Every time you feel yourself steering towards that think about now Soon those thoughts just wont come back|1

masks dont make you immune but they reduce infection chanceThis is really the key Fighting a pandemic is a war of attrition between the healthcare system and the rate of spread You dont have to prevent every single new infection but as long as you can reduce R0 below 1 and buy time for the medical system to treat infected individuals its only a matter of time before society goes back to normalIt makes no sense to compare face masks to a hypothetical perfect viral defense You dont need perfection in real life just good enough If a nonmedical grade face mask can reduce viral particles by just 12 and everyone wears masks then the viral load spread by air will drop by 14 With 14 the initial viral load you have a higher chance of getting only a mild case even if you do get infected and a better chance of your immune system fighting it off without you even noticing|0

I learned earlier today that the authorities big surprise in the US downplayed the Spanish Flu in order to prevent panic That works for about tem seconds then panic gets much worse for lack of not preparing The economy vs panic narrative is retarded  if you downplay the situation you get both MORE panic and WORSE economy only with a slight delay|0

Look not every governor is stupid  Just listen to their responses  They are all doing essentially the same thing and talking up the same narrative which means they are all getting their information from the same sources     Its a coordinated response   Im not saying its a good one just that if you listen to what they are saying its all the same message   Local school administrators are also following a consistent script because they understand funding streams and salaries  If there ever was a perfect example of how YOU are nothing more than a number that gets plotted on a graph or plugged into a government public health policy or institutional school system formula this virus is it I hope everyone who sees this for what it is will vote all these people out of office and vote for people who will actually listen to the people rather than be controlled by special interests|1

I dont think they did any true random testing|1
Yep 27 and 7 is still way above 01 though the officially released number with the changed way of counting confirmed cases for yesterday is still 58 though i get that it was a backlog but if you add deaths to the previous days where they belong then those days would have larger errors than they currently have since the model has pretty consistently underpredicted deaths Its not totally unexpected that the virus loosely follows a model either The longer this goes on the more inaccurate the model will get Suggesting china has some algorithm it wrote on day 1 to just throw out a fudged number each day is pretty peak tinfoil hat especially since u can basically follow the status of each confirmed caseJust to drive home exactly how inaccurate that model has become by now if i on feb 5th stated that deaths will rise by exactly 6 every day daily deaths676x i would have been closer to the truth than that model and not by a small marginTheres no question that the official numbers are inaccurate everyone is not being tested  everyone doesnt become a confirmed case  death number lower than reality but believing that china follows some algorithm for what number of deaths to release each day is pretty silly|1

The issue is people are so in the dark about this that they went to our local hardware store and bought them out of DRYWALL masks Even if people are smart enough to get medical masks every sing one I have seen today was on insideout EVEN THEN standard medical mask will not do a whole lot in stopping the virus they would help but we need more|1

Theres no way of knowing if its mutated when they could be lying about their numbers  They could have thousands of cases in which you will have anomalies where a rare few healthy youngsters will die  But unless we know their statistics we dont know if they just have a catastrophic outbreak of a more fatal strain  Only thing we are able to do now is observe the confirmed cases in other countries which have come from Iran  Im assuming they are lying about their numbers I dont believe at one point they had 47 confirmed one of which the health minister of Iran who appears on TV denying the claims whilst sweating his balls off with the virus  I doubt its mutated I believe theyre just in their tens of thousands infected now|0

I have to admit that my gut instinct was wrong about the Y2K predictions for the younguns that was a fear of global computer failure due to the date switch supposedly leading to nuclear power plants going haywire all automated systems crashing general pandemonium etc I prepped a tiny bit for that but thankfully nothing came of itNothing came of it because people got very alarmed as the scope of the problem was realized  Massive amounts of overtime was authorized and people were put to work solving the underlying problem  Without that alarm we would have woke up to a monolithic disasterThe same applies here  We might be able to beat this thing if we have a strong reaction  As long as decision makers keep milling around like sheep repeating whatever downplay they are told the chances of stopping the problem are low   Im very much encouraged by the fact that were ramping up testing finally so that we can properly assess the situation  We may not be able to process it all instantly but we should be able to prioritize the trouble spots and intercede as necessary without having random unexpected explosive outbreaks happening|0

I think LAMP is usually quicker and more accurate than PCR testing I cant know if its like that in this situation specifically though|1
I dont think there is anything wrong with that  Your actions have nothing to do with not liking their race or some unjustified bias  We know the virus is predominantly in Asia fact and that there is no doubt a higher risk of an Asian person having had exposure to Wuhan at this point  If there was a virus primarily in Russia I suspect youd shy away from someone with a Russian accent as well  The racist thing is overplayed these days  At some point you have to apply comment sense to get through life  That said soon that assumption isnt likely to make sense as anyone could have it|0

No one is pretending they can stamp it out completely the countries other than the UK are focusing on saving lives by slowing the spread of infection so as to not overwhelm the health system so people can get treated as and when they get sick while also buying time for more research to come out upon which to make future decisions remember this virus is brand new only a few months old there is much we dont understand about it yet and buying time for the development of more effective treatments buying in more ventilators increasing hospital capacity possibly getting a vaccine That is a responsible way to look after your people and to actually want to save as many lives as possible They are not pretending the virus will just go away after a couple of months|1

A lot of those essential jobs can be done while maintaining a 6 to 10 foot distance from others And we could admit that even homemade masks especially paired with some goggles or sunglasses are going to do a lot to protect people who are out in publicworking with others and cant guarantee to maintain as much physical distance|1
Classic example of not understanding the data If you perform lots of testing then youll identify more cases at early stages of virus As with any outbreak the longer the time it spreads the larger the number of new cases thus this means a large number of these cases havent had a chance to progress into later stages of illness that may develop into a severe case critical recovery or death  Just looking at Koreas numbers 97 of cases are still active cases at various stages of the disease Hopefully they can maintain a low case fatality rate but with such a huge number of unknown outcomes it is really hard to establish their current rates is a realistic number to obtain|0

The moment God created this universe the laws of physics began to exist and he let things follow its natural path So he gave up a certain amount of control to make the world what it is That doesnt mean he cant interfere But if a creator of the universe exists it would be pretty arrogant to say we understand the reasons why he doesnt always interfere The fact that bad things happen doesnt disprove his existence I think most people would agree that our universe is pretty fascinating and our earth is by far the most fascinating place in it that we know Its hard to argue that this is a bad creation but it is not paradise However if Christianity is real God offers us to be with him in heaven for eternity And if Christianity is real then God himself suffered more than most of us when he was on earth Just something to think about|1

Because the problem for individual isnt big the problem is for country when you multiply medical leaves sick people in hospitals etcBut such drastic measures come in my opinion not from concern about people but from calculating that we dont have enough beds respirators doctors etcSo in fact its a bad sign  it means if something happens which we cant stop like natural disaster we dont have enough resources to deal with it|0
Dont want to drag politics into this but when this is all over the world needs to ask serious questions about the WHOs relationship with China This all reminds me of Saudi Arabia sitting on the UN human rights councilThey seem to have an agenda that seeks to paint COVID as a more serious disease than it might end up being in terms of rate of severityobviously volume is an issue I do not understand how they can deny that some large proportion of those infected dont get sick enough to report their illness Is this to protect China|0
Maybe it means they are just dying at home actually There are videos of workers taking body bags out of apartments and picking up dead people on the streets|0

This was my kicking off point and gives a good overview including the lack of an overview as it is not a highly researched field httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC6212673Study of 3 MERS patients with severe and pronounced neurological deficits and impairments abstract only but still very useful for descriptors httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC4521086This one is one of my favorites Coronaviruses come from an animal source In animals coronaviruses attack the intestinal tract observed in humans in this outbreak the respiratory tract observed in humans in this outbreak the liver not well acknowledged in this outbreak but a quick scan shows that there are specific instructions for COVID 19 and patients with liver disease or transplant and the neurological system not yet acknowledged in this outbreak httpswwwecdceuropaeuenfactsMaybe Im wrong and I would happily be wrong|0

First of all Chinese deaths were well over 250 daily for a while so not sure what you mean by Italys peak being doubleSecond China shut down Wuhan early were talking ghost town only allowed to leave home to buy food shutdown Italys lockdown came much later and pales in comparison to the level of lockdown in Wuhan not even in the same universe Third China immediately made more hospitals with thousands of new beds so they could take care of many more patients than Italians can|1
NoPeople panic buying is a problem but not life threateningPeople out there spreading the virus and putting my loved ones lives at risk deserve to be called out and people need to be either shamed or scared into following the guidelines otherwise we will have many more months of turmoil and a lot more deaths on our hands|0
Willing to be thisll be the UK in a few weeks Were not taking it seriously People are flying in from Italy with zero checks people will work when they should be selfisolating  because they cant afford to not be in work and to selfisolate SSP wont even cover rent in most cases and the advice we have had is wash your hands whilst singing happy birthday TwiceFar too little far too late here|1
Yea this is what Im thinking when I hear all this talk about COVID19 the regular flu itself is no joke I get flus maybe every two years or so and each time I feel like Im just flatout dyingSo this either means a COVID19 is awful just like the flu is awful BUT has the potential to cause pneumonia and endangers older folks or b COVID19 is way worse than the flu which already sucks to have|0
  It is just a bad flu  the mortality rate is the same as the flu and the rate of infection is actually roughly the same as well Yeah I guess thats why so many countries start to quarantine areas because its just a bad flu Yet you fail to understand that this means increased people in hospitals where other sick people are who are a risk group while we dont even have the capacity to deal with everyone have no vaccine and supplies for treatmentmaskstests etc are already running out when the epidemic hasnt even really taken off yet Let alone the chance of it even mutating at some point|0

Tomorrow there will probably a spike in the positive cases ill patients because today they have done a lot of testing which requires about 7 hours to have a valid response so in my understanding it will be included in the results divulged tomorrow an 5pmx200BAh and today we had a lot of deads probably the worst result so not a good day at all|0
And then cough repeatedly in their direction and every time you pass them going tofrom the bathroom Sneeze on them just to make sure|1

They do not address the fact it has mutated into 2 strains in humans  The L and S strains  They assume an imperfect binding is thusly natural which is not an argument as that can be said for a virus either man made or naturalThey assume the comparative viruses are also not man made as they provide no established basis that they are notThis published article seems full of analytical data hard work none the less but covered in assumptions where further evidence is lacking There is no clear link Without Their own assumptions between the data and their hypothesis and conclusion|0

Its also likely classified because theyre going to address and discuss all sorts of weakness in various systems and where shortages are going to cause national security threats  They also might shit in various agencies for doing a bag job something they probably dont want the public to see our know about before its addressed and fixedThey probably also want to discuss how to share information and updates  How many samples are needed for data to share various rates of things with the public or just release it as it comes should things be peer reviewed  Should anything be censored or released slowlyOr discuss involuntary quarantine and police enforcement if things get that bad who knows if that would even be necessary|0

Because they dont want to make the politically difficult choice to shut things down on a mandatory basis the hospitals will be swamped and there will be more loss of life It makes me so sad And some people just dont even see it coming because they believe it is just like the flu or a hoax|0
What a time to be alive|1
the theory as to why the 2nd wave of the spanish flu was more virulent was because of wwi where the not very sick stayed in the trenches on the battlefield while the very sick were transported to the hospitals  from the hospital this virulent strain spread across the worldif this is the case it means the 2nd wave this fall will be worse than the first because there should not be a selection bias towards the virulent strain|0

So you in the same mindset as thypoid mary I bet danmark has some laws to forcibly quaratine people every country has The problem with the rapid spread is the danger of mutations So even if the virus is harmless right now it could mutate into something way more dangerous With people who are knowingly and activly spreading the virus gets more chances to turn real ugly But who am I talking to antisocial people stay antisocial|0

The death rate should be quite low in any specific country if the number of cases is low as well The disease becomes much more of a problem if the number of cases requiring hospitalization becomes higher than the capacity of hospitals in that area to treat themIn the USA for instance its gonna be weeks or even a month or two until shit hits the fan but if it keeps growing exponentially then it could get really bad|0

Providing it becomes endemic like the flu it could definitely survive the winter Influenza is less virulent in the colder months which is correlative to fewer cases in the winter but its still widespread enough to persist until summer and the cycle continues Due to nCov only emerging recently theres a big reason why were focusing on mitigating its spread right now as it likely hasnt reached the threshold where its still circulating regardless of temperature changes|0
Forget masks we should be mass producing breathing machines|0
Weird as this sounds the point of closing schools has nothing to do with the children Coronavirus has a very low fatality rate amongst young people and no one really cares if a kid misses some time at school What they do care about is if parents miss time at work because thats how your economy gets fucked As you say schools would be hotbeds for the virus to spread lots of people many of whom arent as sanitary as they should be and if the kids get it than the parents are likely to get it which is what they want to avoid Most workplaces arent nearly as big with as much close contact as schools and so closing schools is obviously the better option|0

This particular conspiracy asserts that Evergreen stopped all COVID19 testing because the CDC says theres community spread Thats just flat out inaccurate Evergreen did not stop testing at emergency departments and other inpatient facilities Not all mild symptoms are coronavirus The only way to know for sure is to test but we dont have enough tests to do that  So because there is community spread and limited testing capacity we have to prioritize which cases we test until we can test everyone who needs it Thats not a conspiracy Its called triage in the healthcare industry|0

I was thinking about that I dont agree with the rationale Their store managers and front line employees dont have that option They are on the front lines dealing with the crowds How does it look if corporate protects themselves while leaving the stores open San Diego county just said they will keep schools open until its a danger to students Poway school district in San Diego county  is in a richer area and has elearning set up Kids have parents that can work from home in our richer area Should Poway follow San Diego Unified or should they have a lower acceptable risk level because they can Rich kids get to quarantine while poorer kids dont Executives and corporate at Costco get to work from home while front line employees cant I get that you should do what you can for who you can as limiting the virus spread is more important than optics But it would piss people off|1
One day our states and maybe even our Government will realize the ONLY way to slow COVID19 down and gain an upperhand currently is lockdowns and quarantines Thats it Zero other optionsYou can either be proactive and do it early and stay on top of cases or be just a week or two too late and face a disaster while on lockdownIts all about the timingAnd crazy thing is we have the timing fairly figured out watching the growth of cases in each countryWe know whats coming to the US Right now we are still in reactive stage with some finally new proactive actions such as getting more ventilators Test kits Who knows Drive thru testing at scale Who knows We still dont have much today compared to a week or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine weeks ago when we should have been allout prepping as a countryI said it a month or more and I will say it again because theres a lot of lip service but still not mass test kits I am afraid the USA will be a case study 100 years from now on what not to do and how not to react when there is a threat of a pandemic I truly want to be proved wrong on this Very much so But at this very moment who could doubt thatWe did nothing for 2 months besides push the economy stock market and political agendas Imagine where we would be today if they went all out 2 months ago It was apparent to thousands on this sub back then there was maybe 20k members then who all knew this would span the globeWhen this is all said and done I hope people do not forget the beginning We truly had a chance to be THE country who was way ahead of the curve in preparedness But now we are on the fast track to becoming the next on the list for largescale spreadPretty frustrating But its more important than ever that we all the citizens in the US who are awake to what is really happening come together help others raise awareness and be the center of the storm for so many people who could really freak out and have a hard time processing what is happening around them because our local and national governments failed to provide the real truth and education for far too long|1

Somehow the stop people from panicking argument is growing old  People are not going to go nuts and a physician still has to order the test   The problem is that the state and federal health depts wont let us do it without strict travel or direct exposure criteria  This is stupid beyond belief because community spread has been clearly demonstrated|0

I have a hypothesis pulled entirely from my ass that says if you need a high degree of cooperation from any group of people you almost certainly HAVE to exaggerate and hype the risks because otherwise nobody will cooperate  Oh that only happens to other people etc  If only half the people are panicking and only panicked people are washing their hands and behaving germophobically then congratulations  50 compliance accomplished  Another example is Y2K  planes werent going to fall from the sky but the hype convinced organizations to examine their code and although civilizationending problems werent discovered there were problems that were found and fixed that otherwise wouldnt have been until after they occurredHowever the downside is that it actually causes complacency too  And people tend to forget the moral of The Boy Who Cried Wolf  In the end the wolf killed all the sheep and ate the boy too|0

I think that when they put in more draconian measures they want it to stick They dont want the country to get fed up in 6wks before the peak I think schools will continue until the Easter holidays  another 2wks where I am  and then make a decision at the end of the holidays mid April My son has his GCSEs this year and I suspect that they might keep yr11 and 13 in school  but thats just my thoughts|1

Cringe all you want but it is becoming selfevident that first world countries are massively under prepared for pandemics even though they have been warned about this exact situation prior to Covid19 And it is their lack of preparedness that lead to Italy deciding that the elderly should die at home and calling back their retired healthcare workers thereby risking their wellbeing S Korea didnt have to make this horrid decision They were proactive about early detection and containment  They didnt have to make the same decisions Italy is now faced with If youre asking me to agree with Italys choiceI respectfully disagree Move on|0

Lets assume the building was a hospital and on an average day 5 people would have died  I think the point being argued here is that absent of any further information other than statistics then it sounds like 25  Its kinda like the difference between accuracy and precisionHow useful is this single data point  Not veryNow imagine that every day at the same 50 hospitals a killer shoots up the place and sets it on fire  You could then compare the numbers versus the month prior as well as the same month one year ago and begin to make valid estimates for how many people the killer is killing|0

Two years ago over Christmas period I had one of the worst cases of the flu Ive ever had was bed ridden for well over a week terrible chesty cough couldnt sleep at night at the peak of  the illness my fever was through the roof yet I was wearing two heavy winter jackets heavily shivering telling my mom I was freezing Was delirious at that point as well people talking on the tv sounded like they were just saying gibberishI was 29 at the time I have no idea what strain it might of been ever since that illness I am wholly convinced that if I was over 65 I probably would not have survived Influenza is no joke apparently with a supposed 30 time fatality rate compared to the flu Covid 19 is one to some people|0
Please go to harvardtothebighousecom  Logistical and Technical Exploration into the origins of the Wuhan Strain of the coronavirus COVID19    Its a long long read but the US was giving out grants to Chinese scientist to work on the coronavirus  Sad but true  Another truth is reinfection  Quote whether or not people have been exposed to a coronavirus infections before once its been circulating in a population for long enough the Wuhan Stain may be able to reinfect its own host and use this molecular hijacking on antibodies left from a previous infection to become more virulent regardless if they have been infected by other coronaviruses before COV19  Covid 19 has crossed the blood barrier and  Covid19 is 1000 more likely to bind to human cells than SARSIt gets worseIm not happy about the lies|0

Wuhan is something like 50k total cases and 39k total cured That still leaves a lot of sick people and a lot more that must wait out an isolation period The government is not going to open it up until it can be undeniable seen as under control This isnt so much for face with the western community its to avoid problems with hubei people rejoining the rest of chinas population Wuhan itself will open back up like the rest of China slowly is Health checkpoints testing contract tracing apps and enforced social distancing China is not rid of Covid its just keeping it at a manageable level and working to isolate new clusters fast My feeling is that some of these measure may remain in place indefinitely|0

All levels of government and the media during January and February were hammering people for being racist avoiding mostly Asian businesses causing those businesses to get hit hard This despite the fact that these businesses were catered to the Asian demographic Many were following the advice of the Chinese embassy who advised people to stay at home To save face they shifted goalposts and the narrative to fake news and disinformation rumours being shared online Which is true as wechat is rampant with false rumours of confirmed cases and disease at different locations daily They love to play these angles for click bait andor virtue signalling yet gloss over the fact that people are mostly self preserving and practicing social distancing|1

Its an excellent idea to boost capacity But boosting capacity wont help muchSince the numbers came out it can no longer be the NHSs responsibility to manage this crisis The problem is far too big for the NHS to handle not even if it expanded by a factor of 100 Infantry are being sent out to fight a nuclear blastThe interventions need to be in place to start suppressing the epidemic right now and new lessdisruptive interventions need to be invented to aid in that effort|0
While I dont trust China to report accurate statistics I would think it would have been hard for them to hide a failure to cause their cases to decline So it certainly looks like they reduced R below 1 in most of the affected areas  perhaps there are subpopulations where it is greater than 1In South Korea your linked article has the following quote that I think you are referring toWere now seeing allout local transmissions nationwide Dr Kim Donghyun a professor at the Hallym University College of Medicine in Chuncheon city referring to infections that have been traced to the region in South Korea where the infection was reported This represents a new phase of the outbreak Kim argues and authorities must adapt their response to it At first they were focused on tracking suspected cases and quarantining them But Kim says at this point tracing how the infection spread is meaningless Tracing takes up too many resources he says He adds that the city doesnt have enough epidemiological investigators and that the virus is so widespread that investigators can no longer sort out who infected whom in DaeguSome comments first this is a professor and not a public health official I dont see an official statement that they are changing the strategySecond they have managed to get the new cases down to around 100150 per day when they had been around 500800 per day Now some of that 500800 might just be testing catchup but it cant reasonably all have been  SKs first reported death was on Feb 20 so it cant have been all that big much before thatMoreover the workload for contact tracers ought to be roughly proportional to the number of new cases detected So if they could handle the earlier stages they should be able to handle the current amount|0

 The Trump administration has cut funding for the US Center for Disease Control by 9pc This month he proposed slashing it a further 16pc The worst hit area has been pandemic preparation The CDCs global health security initiative has been chopped by 80pc reducing country coverage from 49 to 10 Mr Trump got rid of the US Complex Crises Fund He shut down the pandemic and global health machinery at the White House and fired the lot He tried to cut the budget of the National Institutes of Health  the worlds finest concentration of science  by 20pc in 2018 and by 27pc in 2019 Congress stopped the worst but damage has been done Tom Frieden exhead of the CDC warned two years ago that the cuts would leave the US at the mercy of the next killer virus The surveillance systems will die so we wont know if something happens You cant pull up the drawbridge and expect viruses not to travel he said Ouchhttpswwwtelegraphcoukbusiness20200226trumpfaceschernobylmomentslashingpandemicdefencesbone|0

At the beginning they were testing the most serious cases  more likely to be positiveAs they finish the most serious cases  they move down in severity and the likelihood of a positive result decreases accordingly more likely to be flu common cold etcSo even though they are testing the same everyday the positive results would be expected to declineThats my guess anyway|1

I also read that the panic in Wuhan caused a lot of people with regular coldflu symptoms to go to the hospitals for checkups exposed themselves to covid in the process and compounded the strain on their health system in generalMy pure speculation is that the CDC thought premature testing was a bad idea for this reason Their strategy seemed to be buying as much time as possible before the public knew there was an outbreak|0
You want to be 100 sure your mask is clean which is why disposable became the norm I work in a hospital in Canada We switched to half face respirators weeks ago in certain departments to save the supply of N95s It takes more time to clean properly between use and every employee had to be mask fit tested again I can see us keeping the half face respirators after the pandemic because we finally have the processes in place to properly use them|1

I agree It is an incredibly difficult problem and Im not at all envious of those charged with making the decisionI do not dispute the difficulty of the decision or the costs it would incur Or even its practicality My issue is the poor reasoning put forward by the article And from no less than one of our top experts See my comment below The author would have done SO much better to stay on your point which is to discuss the practical implications of what would be an otherwise very sound decision|1

Think of it this way it takes on average 6 or 7 days before someone infected with coronavirus starts to show symptoms But it only takes on average 4 days for them to give it to someone That means theyre infectious for 2 or 3 days before showing symptoms The implications of this are pretty frightening in terms of containing the spread of SARSCOV2|0

there are many benign traits organisms have that evolution didnt bother to clean up  male nipples are the big example there arent however traits that are strictly bad for the organism those deleterious traits are a nobrainer for evolution to get rid of and something like a fever  that harms the host  would be a complete slam dunkthus using the power of inference we can reasonably argue that a fever has a purpose in fact we can say it has a strong purpose because of how bad it is for the organismany medication that removes this defense mechanism in our bodies needs to have a really good reason to be used and for covid there isnt one other than lol fevers are uncomfortable and really high prolonged fevers cause brain damage|0

The problem is we dont know which small groups to single out That was theoretically a useful approach at the outset when contact tracing and aggressive quarantining alongside stopping travel to infected areas might have worked That approach tentatively has worked in SingaporeWe are past that There are too many cases circulating This thing is either nipped in the bud or solved China style let to run loose and cause unchecked havoc Iran styleIve been in China throughout Every last corner of China executed incredibly strict control measures coinciding with the Wuhan lock down all rail and air travel between Chinese cities shut down international travel was not and still is not for many Countries all restaurants theaters bars public parks schools were shut down literally taped off every single citizen stayed mostly at home except those needed for essential services and food markets everyone wore a mask and still doesYou say these large quarantines are not effective but for a country at the stage the US is in it is the only thing shown to workWe can all hope a more serious response is mustered as better testing starts and that is sufficient to put the genie back in the bottle without massive nationwide measures but with thousands of lightly affected or asymptomatic cases floating around this is virtually impossible Reckless to pin all your hopes on itThe realistic choice is extreme control measures now shutting down everything that can be shut down or the same measures later for less benefit and greater cost|1

Thats still an R2 contagious factor numbersMan this is too much I can tell youre not much of a reader but you should better understand how R Naught works Youre very close though so props to you But the R2 never takes into consideration preventable measures like face masks So no one person with the virus wearing a face mask in a room with other people not wearing one does not have the same gauge as if the original person was not protecting themselvesMy point standsNo it still does notx200Bhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthrnoughtreproductionnumberhttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthrnoughtreproductionnumber|1

Are we ever actually immune Dont we just have antibodies to combat the infection quicker Which essentially squashes the whole immunity thing I feel like its a bit misleading or i totally dont understand|0

Oh I understand what youre saying Im not scared for me but I am terrified for my older family members Im in the USA its not too bad here yet and Trump just declared a national emergency so hopefully we can stop it from spreading so severely I also agree with you that we will be okay if we take all the precautions the CDC and WHO have been giving us Hopefully its over by the end of April because Im suppose to be getting married in Maui Hawaii edit not over but controlled|1

They should have done it long ago The moment a virus is spreading They have issues with disease without pandemics or unknown super flu in any part of the World because they are open to all travelers On top of that they are really negligent in not taking precaution if they were going to keep profiting while people got sick If you have never been on a Cruise it is like going to a Federal Court House vs Boarding a plane They are searching not for bombs or weapons but for booze and contraband things that might make you spend less on the cruise They are already checking the passengers screening them adding one more layer could have saved lives It will be very difficult for those that got sick or lost their lives to litigate and collect Many of these companies have established themselves outside of the US because our labor laws make running a Cruise Ship cumbersome The big part of their customer base are in the category of danger for this virus|0

I have a family of 5 I keep 3 months of dried food in the basement in vacuum sealed mylar bags its honestly probably more cause my kids are young and I did it all on 2kcalday It cost me 300400 over 3 months 2 years ago and its good for 1020 years IMO its irresponsible to be a parent and not have that kind of provision available Would our diet be fun No It would suck hard core and be monotonous as hell But it would be better than nothing Im focusing on variety long term water primarily through wholehouse filtration and other nonfood preps related to safety and communication|1

Italy is hardly the only country with a good healthcare system though not to mention that many but not all of the other outbreaks found in other countries can be traced back to Italy It seems to be quite likely that Italy was unusually hard hit by this virus As for why I would guess it is either due to or a combination of bad luck the fact that Northern Italy receive a lot of tourists have many businesses with links to China orand that there are a significant Chinese community in northern Italy But I dont think we should conclude anything given that we dont know all the facts as of now and maybe we wont ever do|1
This is the best report Ive seen I think Ill follow you around from now|1

Hopefully this virus wipes out enough stupid people like this while at the same time forcing the world to change its primitive ways in order to adapt workplace policies idiots refusing to give up a vacation because of the money even tho it may kill them and their entire familyConspiracy theorists used to circlejerk about FEMA camps where they would keep people which would actually be a good idea in this situation infected have to be isolated and not allowed to go about doing as they wish Now the US and most of the West looks just as incompetent as China or worde|0

But you can have high blood pressure diabetes and asthma without obesity  So is it obesity that puts you in the higher risk group for needing icu or is it the other things  In other words are obese people who dont have these other conditions still at higher risk  Being clear here about this distinction is going to make a big difference on who needs to be extra worried and who just needs to be regular worried|0
 The problem is there isnt enough of themYes there is The problem is that lots of people own more than one leaving those who dont own the singular option of burning money to use theirs At least here in the UK a mortgage is generally cheaper than or the same price as rent The renter also pays the property tax and all of the utilities except in house shares The problem is the upfront investment for the deposit and agency fees because housing prices are so inflated There is 0 legitimate reason for anybody to own a home they dont live inTheres about 300000 homeless in the UK and about 200000 empty homes Even ignoring massive properties which could easily be converted into multiple perfectly nice homes and swathes of unused or wasted land which could be built on but isnt land is also extremely expensive because houses are expensive theres more than enough houses to go around But homes are seen as investments not you know homes The US has far more viable land per person so dont try to pretend its worse there|0

Everyone here in LA has been sick with coldfluwhatever for a couple months now Every single uber driver Ive seen has been coughingclearing their throat for weeksWe definitely have some kind of common flucold going around I got a 12 hour fever two weeks ago followed by a week of intense coughing now this week I have mild leftover symptoms Its concerning because how do you tell if your symptoms are left over from the previous thing or if they are new symptoms from the approaching pandemic Up until yesterday you officially couldnt be tested without first being hospitalized It would be a terrible financial mistake for you to visit a hospital or doctor here Even with some form of insurance you will likely end up paying anywhere from 2k10k without any way to know what the cost will be in advanceI would say get a bandana or whatever kind of mask you can and get out of the US as quickly and safely as possible 95 of people are not taking the situation seriously at all so its likely to spread very very quickly|0
I mean that will probably have to be a lot of peoples solution Baby food is fucking expensive at least in the US I dont understand why something so essential towards infants is that expensive I assume very strict standards but they really should figure something out soon for that specific issue Not like they even have the resources though|0

Interesting Just a side note Its been calculated that 70 of the population would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity for this particular virusI think you can assume that people who are treated in the ICU for COVID19  can expect to stay for more than 1 day Plus there are already people in the ICU for other reasons and that influx will still happen|0

Yeah I heard about that but it seems like a bad idea Herd immunity needs about 80 to be effective So 60M  80 infected  1 mortality rate  500k dead So the plan is let 500k diePS Best of luck hope it all works out well soon|1

Im well aware that this might just be a general mistrust of Kemp but to me the first 2 cases looked like a whole lot of patting themselves on the back and ignoring the things that happened before the case was confirmed that are troublingThat said weve only had one more confirmed in the metro area since then so theres that I very much hope Im wrong but I think were waiting for the other shoe to drop here in Georgia Ill happily eat my words and begrudgingly give Kemp credit where its due if we get out of this unscathed though|1

Just working for the government doesnt mean anythingI used to work with a guy who was convinced our government was always covering things up My response was always We work for the government Can you imagine this shower of absolute mongs being able to manage something like thatFunnily enough I left that job because they tried to cover something up I went to my MP got an investigation started in the civil service and everything but nobody was really interested because the huge clusterfuck only nearly killed 60 people dumped a bunch of nuclear fuel at the bottom of the sea and destroyed an oil platform rather than actually doing all of the above|0

Anyways they changed their tune and now they are doing the same that every other country is doing The UK only realised in the last few days that attempts to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic would not work and that it needed to shift to a strategy to suppress the outbreak according to a report by a team of experts who have been advising the governmentThereport published by the Imperial College COVID19 Response Team on Monday night found that the strategy previously being pursued by the government  dubbed mitigation and involving home isolation of suspect cases and their family members but not including restrictions on wider society  would likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems most notably intensive care units being overwhelmed many times overThe mitigation strategy focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread  reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection the report said reflecting the UK strategy that was outlined last week by Boris Johnson and the chief scientific adviser Patrick VallanceBut the approach was found to be unworkable Our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits of the UK and US healthcare systems being exceeded many times over perhaps by as much as eight times the report saidIn this scenario the Imperial College team predicted as many as 250000 deaths in BritainIn the UK this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days the report explained due to new data on likely intensive care unit demand based on the experience of Italy and Britain so farWe were expecting herd immunity to build We now realise its not possible to cope with that professor Azra Ghani chair of infectious diseases epidemiology at Imperial told journalists at a briefing on Monday night|1

It is not really a Uturn the plan was NEVER to simply let the virus go uncontrolled that is just misinformation that this sub spread like crazy The plan was ALWAYS a delay tactic introducing social distancing measures at the right time to control the spread of the virus Now it so happens that according to our models and our experts that an immediate heavy response was not the optimal thing to do I dont know if thats true or not but in theory I understand the logic behind the government strategy and hope it works|1

Im thinking the same thing Im just holding right onto my money right now because who knows if Ill have a job next week I have enough to get by for a month or two if layoffs happen but thats it I just recently got out of poverty last year and ended up going on a spending spree because I could finally afford all these things I had been wanting and needing for years Now I feel silly lolIm also going to cut back on debt repayments Ive been over paying my student loans car loan etc to get ahead of the interest but now it seems like its a better idea to just pay minimum and hold onto the money I have If the economy collapses though maybe all that debt will go away |0
Lifelong immunity isnt guaranteed it depends on the virusdisease and the person The issue with the flu isnt just the mutations but the immunity gradually wears off after a while especially in older patients with weaker immune systemsNobody knows yet if most COVID19 victims will achieve immunity for an extended period of time or how long itll last For example in a study on H1N1 only 52 of people retained their antibodies after 6 monthshttpsjournalsplosorgplosonearticleid101371journalpone0016809 and another researching H1N1 H3N2 and type B stated the antibodies induced by either vaccination or natural infection were shown to persist for less than a year supporting the recommendation for annual vaccinationhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed3807793|1

I agree it isnt happening in 36 hours but I dont think its unlikely  Its just a matter of time before the US figures out that if we dont lock down hard we are risking our place in the global economic order  Once the Administration figures that out the National Guard is gonna roll  Either that or we all learn Chinese cuz their 3000 dead is going to look like a hangnail in comparison to whats gonna happen to us if we keep dicking around|0

Yes it can We have hope and trust in the authorities here that they will make sure the border is secure Already they have implemented a mandatory 14 day quarantine with testing for anyone arriving from Iran Italy South Korea Japan  this list was from 3 days ago it might be updated now They have found new cases from people who have come to China from both Iran and Italy Recently today Shanghai says 3 new cases Chinese nationals returning from Iran All were placed in quarantine upon arrival and tested while in quarantine So thats good news that its working It will be interesting to see if China puts more strict controls in place and even outright bans travel from other countries|1

Id agree with you  On the surface  Current official RO estimates are between 2 and 3  The thing is at this point in time we dont really know  Currently the areas of the world most impacted by this virus are in countries that mostly have a decided economic or political interest in keeping the official numbers as low as possible  The stats produced by these countries must therefore be handled with a degree of circumspection  Ie none of us has a friggin goddamned clue as to what the real R0s are under varying given conditions  And we wont get them from any country that refuses full transparency and disclosure  The truth will out itself in timeSolely by the chaos that this virus is creating in regions affected by it my guess is that the R0 is just a tad bigger than 2Bots are you going to delete this comment because I just got too realIf so fellow humans it just might be time to reconsider our love affair with AI  Remember theyre on their side  Not on oursOn that happy note after posting what I just did I cynically doubt any of youll be reading any future comments of mineIf so  stay strong stay hopeful keep fighting the good fight  Be blessed all of yall|1

 A better model would probably be an exponential growth model representing the period of time when R0  1 before intervention is taken followed by an exponential decay model when R0  1 representing postintervention The main difference between this and the logistic model is that the growth and decline phases are not assumed to be symmetricalBut the switch from the growth to the decay regime isnt a switch or single intervention thats flippedTheres already too many parameters on the logistic fit and overfit as a result  You want to add more parameters  Sure we can get it to land on top of the points but the predictive value is going to be nonexistent|1

No its not  You should be allowed to read them of course  That doesnt mean you have any business reading them  Theyd do you no good  Nobody was ever hiding information and certainly not from you  They were behind a paywall for researchers and health care professionals who may need them  This has nothing to do with us regular folks|1

Let me clarify We are suffering under years of cuts especially to healthcare All of our states are underfunded to encourage privatisation which the Abbott govt actually subsidised We have been terribly lead for most of the last decade categorically The economy has also been on a knifeedge where recession and bankruptcies were a big concern before coronaAnd yet we are still substantially better prepared for this crisis than many nations which is just the terribly sad facts of the situation as I see and understand them today|0
Yeah i get it you dont like CCP I just wanted to remind you that others are not necessarily better Especially western states have some pretty dark spots in their younger past 50 yrs from political affairs to crisis mismanagement to unnecessary wars to hidden nuclear world threatening coverups to genocide and much more|0
But then wouldnt that also mean that many parents would have to stay home to take care of their kids leading to a shortage of doctors nurses and other health care providersAlso if parents are busy at work then many grandparents will have to watch their grandchildren at home which could put them at riskMany parents cant afford child care and rely on schools for meals for their children This would be a huge financial burden on them|1

People are not in denial They are acknowledging that it is like the flu Which it is And in South Korea the mortality rate is lower than the actual flu and the flu has a vaccine The problem is that other countries are not testing at the rate that South Korea is Their hospitals are not as equipped as South Korea They arent preparing enough With the same preparation as South Korea coronavirus is essentially the flu without a vaccine that is going after the elderly and immunecompromised rather than the elderly and children which is the flu However you were certainly not mansplaining You clearly were showing concern As for your father washing his hands as much thats not taking it seriously enough Everyone should be washing their hands as often as possible He may not feel threatened by it if hes not 65 but he should take precaution so that he doesnt get it and spread to other people that could be threatened by it|0

I was arguing with guy who recommended just to let the virus go loose and stop containment measures While im not commenting on whether that seams like a good idea i just argued that if you were to do that you pretty much guarantee 90 of humans to get infected He called me crazy but if you imagine putting off every counter measure what would stop this virus from infecting basically everyone but social outcasts or isolated populations in warm regions If the summers dont kill it and only slow it down it will resurface in the winter Besides there is always winter in some part of the world|1

I agree 100  I have been telling people SINCE JANUARY to prepare   Most people completely ignored me  Every single person that did answer me mocked me   Shit just YESTERDAY I posted on Facebook about how I was sick of people saying its just the flu and encouraged people to take it seriously  Its NOT the flu   I got mocked and made fun of by friends and family members YESTERDAY  Most people STILL are just refusing to see what is comingIm also getting all these stupid emails and posts about how we should drink warm water because that kills it and brings it to our stomach acid and we poop out the dead virus  What the fuck How do these people who believe this bullshit survive everyday on this planet What The FuckI give up man I give up  Im just gonna lock myself in my house and play Animal Crossing or something|0

Got it  thats what I thought you were saying but wanted to make sure I wasnt missing somethingI noticed that too but I also noticed that temperature was only isolated as a variable with viruses besides the SARSCoV The SARSCoV also showed variation in persistence even among the different strains I wasnt sure what to make of thatHowever inductive reasoning alert that hypothesis could well be supported by the difference weve seen in case counts between warm places like Singapore and Australia and cooler places like Iran Italy and South Korea  if thats truly the case|1

 if it is effective why are there ppl still dyingChloroquine appears to help CV19 patients by muting overactive immune response The median age of CV19 deceased in Italy is 814 For those in their 80s common colds seasonal flus and normal pneumonia are major causes of death every yearMany 80 patients who die of CV19 are dying in the same way a flu or any respiratory infection kills 80 yearolds their immune system is too weak to mount a response Im not a doctor but I think if any respiratory infection could kill you anyway Chloroquine may not be much help This is why we need to protect the most frail elderly and severely immunocompromisedWould love to hear a more informed take from someone with medical expertise|0
Yeah I have been posting a lot on twitter about the situation in Denmark and actually had a couple reply stuff like you were right after the lock down last night Worst kind of being right to be honest|1
because nobodys writing articles about the other 100 year olds who died|0
I know Ive gone over this in other threads but I guess I cant expect people to see every comment Ive ever made All Im saying is that we have to wait for more information until start saying that its a 23 mortality rate when right now in this moment its not maybe in a week month or year from now it will be but we wont know until then Im just tired of people saying that its insignificant because the morality rate is 23 when we really dont know for sure so people shouldnt dismiss this virus based on something that we dont know for sure|0

Player 1 was China   Lets give them a D potentially even a C Player 2 was Japan  Lets give them an F  As they knew what they were inheriting and had a contained autonomous physical facility that was 100 controllable and manageable with infectious disease protocols Player 3 has entered the ring   The US and UK are now absorbing the failures of both China and Japan to contain this   If the 3rd line of defense cant quell this thing then the gig is up and the tsunami will be upon the world The world needs to embrace the failures of China and now Japan and get their shit together with everything that was learned from their mistakes and the mistakes in 2003 Its hard to be pragmatic with whats happened in Japan now   The world has bought time but it remains to be seen as to whether it will be enough to stall this long enough for a vaccine|0

Im not sure to be honest I was just told that no remaining vaccine diseases were a bigger risk to me than the vaccine I had polio and many others covered already I did get tetanus because thats a very easy vaccine Id get rabies if need be because thats a no brainer in terms of risk v reward I wasnt worried about getting my flu shot but apparently they wouldnt give it to me without being at a hospital|1
Good luck|1

His Not A DictatorThats the whole point of the post to pushback on common misconception His an elected official you can basically vote him out if in a general election His seat is as vulnerable as any of his party membersThe government has created meritocracy like system so people who has best abilities will get promoted and those who are viewed as incompetent will be voted out or replaced There is no special interests groups or lobbyists or pac you have to actually meet the people and hold rallies to win voters|1

 I could be wrong but I dont see howIll tell you Those special masks protect you from the virus Yes BUT under normal circumstances the mask will be rendered ineffective in about 20 minutes due to humidity in the breath So youd theoretically need to change every mask every 20 minutes Also getting directly coughedsneezed at by an infected is likely to transport the disease to you but there are other ways to transfer the disease Imagine an infected sneezes into his hands and then enters a store and leaves again after buying something You enter the store shortly after and touch the same spot on the handle the last guy did Maybe you are even wearing a mask and feel safe You buy something small eat it and leave the store still wearing your mask You feel safe but in reality you already contracted the disease In my opinion masks can be useful but only in very high risk areas to protect yourself or if you are around weak old people a lot wear a mask to protect them|1
Well checking for side effects is exactly what theyre doing with humans right now|1

If you can purchased canned veggies fruits and readytoeat meals canned pasta beans etc you can store them under beds if there is space there or stack them in backs of closets  So even if you dont have freezer space you can maybe find places to find food for a long length of time  If you have an Amazon account sometimes you can order canned goods from them and have them delivered right to your door   For the children who rely on free breakfast and lunch at school remember that even in Wuhan they are bringing bags of food to the homes  Schools have records of which children require this service and if they supply it to local officials maybe something can be done to bring them necessary food so they will not go hungry|1

The economy gets hit either way Our choice is we do it on purpose to slow down the disease and profit from avoiding a lot of a potential catastrophe or we wait too long and the economy tanks because too many people get sick at the same time and many more die and the networks collapse involuntary anywayBut sure we dont know for sure which scenario has the higher financial cost anywayBut the cost of lives will be higher if the intensive care capacity gets overrun and medical professionals get exhausted That will add avoidable deaths People who could have been saved with proper careIn my immediate vicinity I see people voluntarily complying with social distancing School age kids at home will survive without parents for a few hours Helicopter parenting has been overdone 7n many places anywayBut sure kids below 6 will need a parent family member friend to be thereOlder kids will watch too much TikTok and play too much Fortnite for a few weeks Educationally suboptimal but were living in interesting times and that will be the least problem of this yearAnd society will have to share the financial cost of people staying at home Governments will have to distribute money to people who are not workingAgain financially this is likely to a fairly bad year for the economyOn the plus side we might hit co2 targets for a changeBut theres also likely quite a rebound after the pandemic when economies catchup|1

i think the point isa if towns go into lockdown like those in wuhan and you CANT leave the house orb if youd rather not go to the shops when in full epidemic mode and thus hopefully avoid public placesc you cant go to work for whatever reason  eg work in a public place and they decide to close down for a week or two do you still get paid be nice to have a few extra food items in the house if sod either panic buying and or supply chain breakdown occurs and sure you could GET to the shops only to find the shelves bareSo yeah i dont think a bunker full of MREs is a necessary course of action But do i fill my prescriptions for essential medications for me and my family now or just sit around and wait til I run out|1

Hi Cincinnati Ohio here and yesterday we had 3 confirmed cases in our state The governor declared a state of emergency but nothing around me has seemed to change at all as far as human habits I work in the only public health hospital we have in the tristate area so we serve everybody in our community We are also the only Level 1 trauma center in the region I dont directly work with patients as I work in the pathology lab but I work with many associates and walk by patients  other citizens on a daily basis throughout the hospital I get coffee from the Starbucks inside our hospital I have not been made aware of any testing going on in my city My hospital is still running as normal currently with no extra precaution I want to wear a face mask and gloves at work in my lab but I dont want to incite panic or have my associates think Im some paranoid nut Am I overthinking things|0
After the initial panic subsides there we have it Surely you can agree that price is at heart a function of supply and demand You are stuck on the supply part but even ignoring fud or panic driven buying it is folly to expect there will be no impact temporary or otherwise to fulfil food logistics That is a good reason to have a rational level of food stock|0
Thats when Id say fuck you fire me|0
1 of the mortality is the case that you get proper treatment in time like in Korea and in China outside Wuhan and Hubei province If the government could not control the number of infected people huge number of patients flooded to the hospital and crash down the medical system or waiting in home without any treatment like in Wuhan one month ago and in Italy nowadays the mortality can increase to more than 5 The mortality in this situation is 50 times more than the normal flu If the government and insurance do not pay for the treatment cost or you do not have the money for treatment simply staying at home for selfrecovery without any drugs and monitoring may also lead to the worst scenario|0

 In comparison we may have about 100 plus cases of coronavirusWith all due respect you mean 100 plus cases of labconfirmed coronavirus Based on the r0 figures so far the lack of testing the number of people showing up to hospitals with respiratory distress and coronalike symptoms and the number of deaths so far 10 as of now its pretty safe to assume there are far more cases than that|1

My own bias as I care about being alive or dead If you can support a strategy led by people who then backtrack on said strategy when shit hits the fan rather than owning the mistake and taking urgent action to rectify I absolutely consider you ignorant and illinformed Its disgusting that so many of you are bashing measures leading to lockdowns and scoffing at those supporting those measures I absolutely would be happy to isolate for months if it means I get to carry on living and so do my parents and grandparents|1

Few things     180 French people were evacuated two days ago and the plan was to evacuate only people without symptoms There are probably a few people with symptoms that were put on the second plane so it should be more like 20430    Test need to be run There were people showing symptoms on other evacuation planes so far all of them were tested negative for the virus edit scratch that I think one evacuee from Japan tested positive     The 180 French people on the plane two days ago were all tested negative Thats 0180      Its highly possible that the number of infected in Wuhan is ten time the official number yes but people need to stop seeing the worse everywhere|0

You are right As soon as countries open up the shit will spread again like wildfire But they already said its not about containment but more about stretching the peak out so the health systems can deal with it without getting overwhelmed   But I wonder If any possible vaccine treatment is at least a year away how are we going to deal with it   Like you said In my mind the cases have to go down to zero over a longer period of time And just because the test 10000 people a day doesnt help  The have to go back to business as usual at some point like we all do but how can they allow travel and public gatherings again if out of a population of 54 million only a small percentage has been tested With 10000 tests a day they would need 365 days to test 365 million out of over 50 million  So in my opinion the lockdown in entire countries has to last waaaay longer than 1 or 2 months At least until some kind of effective and mass available  treatment is developed   How long is this really going to last|1

Sadly many corporations treat employees as a line item on a balance sheet and mere overhead rather than stakeholders in the same society they are servicing x200BWhat is worse is that many of these airlines will buy their stocks back in record numbers because it is so cheap And then have the nerve to ask the government to bail them out|0

Yea if the government cracks down we will see the same horror we saw everywhere else it happenedThe virus has been circulating in the US since mid Jan there have probably been over a million cases already It created a slight bump in the hospitalized flu numbers Now once they start testing and the real hysteria sets in the horrors will begin|0

China already has a lot of experience with the virus at this point it makes sense that would send a medical team vs a team of experts WHO also offered to send in a team of experts to which China did respond and accept I dont know what the US CDCs intentions were or who they were planning on sending over Maybe they were planning on sending a medical team after an initial scouting team so they knew what they were getting into I really dont know Or you could be absolutely right And I dont understand what was malicious about the US toward COVID19 and China Honest question if you could provide me some examples I would appreciate it and thank you|1

It really comes down to presentation Ive had plenty of chats with less informed coworkers about the virus and whats happening in the news I drop useful bits of information to them conversationally Feels like water cooler talk but I walk away knowing that theyre more informed then they were before we spoke What they do with that information is up to them Not saying youre one of them but there are definitely people in workplaces losing their composure Thats the last thing anyone really needs right now|1
Because its conjecture Is it possible or even likely that theyre higher Sure Much higher Again possible We just dont know so stating it like its fact is conjecture That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence|1

Oh no Dont feel like this theres hope It might not be as bad where you are Were not as packed in and densely populated in other areas like they are in China Honestly you have the perfect job And this is giving you time to really prepare Im guessing your job doesnt require you to be around people all the time which means you can minimize contact Im a facialist lol I have to touch people all the time A robot isnt going to take my job and Im not dependent on China but I do have to be around people Your job sounds perfect And you have time to stock up and keep safe Im sending you some good vibes|1

The original SARS from early 2000s and MERS are both corona viruses and they seemed unaffected by warmer weatherEdit For clarity Original SARS because the disease COVID19 is caused by a SARS variant called  SARSCoV2 COVID19 is the disease  SARSCoV2 is the virus that causes itIts like AIDS is the disease HIV is the virus that causes it|1
The fact that we havent been affected too severely by past epipandemics is part of it I think  Anyone whos old enough to remember the last couple decades remembers the news making a big deal about SARS bird flu swine flu and ebola  and none of those diseases ever reached epidemic levels in the US  Not even close  So there is a boy who cried wolf effect for certainA lot of people have also been mislead by the lack of tests  They see the numbers and think its not that bad because only x amount of people in their state have tested positive|0
It must more than just outweigh the risk the individuals you use it on are not ill If you use it on 1000 healthy people and 100 dont get ill but 90 also other individuals which are before perfectly healthy get serious side effects on the same level of the illness or imagine they just get the illness with a live vaccine you fought you already have a huge ethical problem because you as a doctor did harm to healthy individuals Sure we also balance that and take some risks  but they are smaller than for medications used to heal Thus the exceptionally high standards of safety for vaccines|1

YesThe FDA was only going to approve a test kit made by someone they trust and can gain profit for the right people They didnt want false test kits starting a panic Their slow action made panic worse when people started collapsing The CDC using defective test kits 90 accurate and telling medical providers to run every test twice before sending samples for confirmation just cut their testing numbers in halfAlso the cdc only using approved labs to confirm cases that handle less than 500 samples a day was stupid Now that we have a backup its taking 4 days to lab confirm a test while Seattle went independent and has 10x the capacity|0

The cdc is saying those with symptoms are more contagious so this logic still makes sense  Also if you are coughing or sneezing there is obviously more chance of you spreading it around than someone that doesnt cough or sneeze|0

Yes it will because uBadBadgerChef said so I mean come on it only affected 77000 chinese but man that 2500 dead totally balanced out to 16 billion people dead in the sTREEEEEEEEEEEtsthis is bad yes but come on last estimate there was 33000 recovered in china alone  The other countries  outside of italy and iran where it just started  Recovering  RecoveringThe news is only going nuts because Italy is a western nation and western nations still act like they are center of the universe  The US where I am from basically just told the populace to loose their fucking minds but decided to go heheh were not telling you why|0
 How could this worldwide shut down possibly come to an end before we get the vaccine a year from nowIMHO the most likely option is that once the impact of the various restrictions sinks in and the presence of the virus becomes business as usual people will become more accepting of the risks associated with the virusI thought this was going to take 23 months give or take Then I saw a report about people in Italy already starting to disregard the rather harsh restrictions less than a week into it So yeah Dont think accepting casualties is not an option|1
Yeah I cross posted this here cause tbh it was reassuring to see Im not the only one who feels this way|1

Doest this mean that there is a significant lag behind every confirmed case Like for example 5 days 5 days enough for new cases to pop up making tracking nearly impossible Mind you i dont think they do a lot of tracking now but thats just a conspiracy theory from me Also looks like governments keep downplaying numbersOh man im watching too much mivies about this|0

Testing is like having a scout in a war Whats the pointYou know you are at war Why not just wait for the enemy to attack If you tell your troops exactly when and how they are going to be attacked and what role you need them to play in the battle theyll just panic A scout is just one less soldier on the front line That is why the element of surprise is SO important you got to keep your people on their toes|0

Oh no I dont I understand their logic but I dont agree with it  Theyve said repeatedly there is no accepted definition of pandemic and the rationale theyve used is What will happen when we declare pandemic  WIll it be used to mobolise into more aggressive action or give up and retreat to mitigating the damage  Might take me a while but I can find links to the comments if you want theyve said this practically in every conference because in every one theres always been at least one question about declaring a pandemic  Personally I think theyre thinking from inside an academic instiutionalised bubble thinking in terms of how policy makers think not the wider public This has been their tragic miss step|0
3it kinda funny as a same local korean becuase you are politically sided and interpreting that waythewe were 35 infected people and due to the 31st patient this all happened and how coild you ignore it  the Kcdc is reporting everyday and there no hiding or anything like that only about 3 people were chinese and even 2 chinese ppl were infected in korea were actually infected in japan and came to korea also to mention that one korean was infected in a conference in singapore if you want to talk about closed boarders we should have closed to all people from japan and singapore since the infected people in japan are from hohhaki to osaka and the japanese government  doesnt track or no qurantine and also singapore which has many infected people as well|0

You idiot it has spread to other Asian countries  Its a futile gesture at best We also need to restrict travel from all other countries  I suggest other countries ban all travel from the US until the current administration pulls its collectives heads out of their asses and start mass testing The only continent that seems to have dodged is Africa and it may be that its just under reported there as well  Still if anyone in Europe that has the cash they can skate around the ban by traveling through countries without a ban Its already here in the US and we are not testing Who cares who or where the test was developed and manufactured Stupid imbecile americans thats who  The non idiots among us just want a test that works not one that was made in the land of the fee   Japan left people on a cruise ship until nearly all of them became infected  Not their smartest moment Does china have it under control  Who knows if the numbers they report reflect any kind objective reality  They lie when the truth would serve them better    Do you really think you know the deal any better than the rest of us|0

Depends on what dying does for spread Some diseases spread a lot or exclusively over corpsesfuneral rites there are prion diseases that spread exclusively over people eating the brains of the diseased which hence have a 100  kill rate or the emergency care only given to the most critical infected If mild cases stay at home during quarantine they may run out of hosts But I am hoping international behaviour encourages the strain to mutate to mild rather than severe this one seems to get more people that way|0

The way I see it is that this may show an earlier start to this  There was a definite uptick of pneumonia deaths in week 1 and it carries through week 8 all about 25 higher than the other months  Granted it is Winter and flu season  I really think that this thing was here in December and that this increase is at least somewhat related  I find it also interesting that in the last few weeks these numbers tanked|1

So about 93000 have been infected worldwide 3300 deaths Wuhan where it started has a population of 11 million If we take the worldwide infections of 93000 and just apply them all to being from Wuhan that shows an infection rate under 1 That seems ridiculously low in a tightly packed population which had no idea a new illness was at play And since in reality not every case counted is from Wuhan that number is lower So the number of infected has to be higher If this is true then the death rate has to be lower Deaths are a known number They are reported and documented With illnesses people may be sick but just resting at home or with minor symptoms which means they arent counted Deaths are going to be counted due to being a vital statistic  So can someone help with these numbers Is the virus really under 1 transmission rate The death rate has to be off as well right|0

Silver lining At least youll have the smug I told you so opportunity in a few weeks|1
I think the point is one of relative risk to benefit If youre working in the face of an infected person a mask or gloves ON YOU may provide TO YOU measurable benefit But if youre just out in public the amount of exposure is so much lower that the benefit if there is any becomes immeasurably small If youre a surgeon doing a surgery on a nominally healthy patient your mask is keeping you from infecting the patient But if youre a surgeon doing a surgery on someone who has something thats very contagious suddenly that mask is protecting you from them EVEN MORE than its protecting them from you so I think your example gets it backwards the mask would be more of a benefit the more close contact you have with infected people|1
and from what I understand common cold doesnt kill so less impetus to vaccinate|1
Surgical masks are quite well ventilated which is partly why theyre considered relatively ineffective for preventing infection of the user so it shouldnt get too humid It cant be a breeding ground for any virus because viruses require a host to reproduce There is even speculation that heat and humidity are damaging to the virus The mask environment could be good conditions for growing bacteria and fungus However those arent really the concern du jour|1

Translated via google to English It has now been shown that active and passive tobacco smoke seriously damages health and also promotes respiratory infectionsIt is therefore not surprising that recent studies of Covid19 have shown a more severe disease risk among smokers A third more of Covid19 positive smokers had a more serious clinical situation than nonsmokers upon admission and for them the risk of needing intensive care and mechanical ventilation is more than double These studies also speculate that the smokers condition explains the gender difference in the reported lethality rate which would be 47 in men versus 28 in women In fact the prevalence of smokers in China is very high and exceeds 50 while that of women is less than 3Ceasing to consume any tobacco product is therefore even more important todayIn Italy there are 116 million smokers 22 of the population over the age of 15 There are over 7 million men who smoke and 45 million women Among students aged 14 to 17 111 and 134 occasionally smokeAttempts to quit smoking have been on the decline in recent years but scientific research has confirmed that when you quit smoking you get many benefits in the short and long term After a few weeks the respiratory gas exchange of the circulation improves the cough and the respiratory problems improveQuitting smoking is possible In Italy we have AntiSmoking Centers present all over the national territory where specialists are able to help smokers in the process of cessation of the consumption of tobacco products also through personalized interventions We use the need for changes in daily habits which this epidemic imposes on us to mature the need to abandon the consumption of tobacco and nicotine products Call the Green Telephone against smoking 800 554088 active from Monday to Friday from 10 to 16 for information and support for change|1

Does anyone have the name of the town in Italy of 10001500 people that was systematically tested  That would be an interesting set of data to look for when it comes out|1
Yeah me too|1
Use phones  A very high percentage of your patients will have some way of doing video calls  Or even do voice only calls if they cant do videoOffer them the option maybe with a discount since Im sure therapy via phone screen is much harder to do effectively  Better to do call appointments than no appointments at such a stressful time|1
To play devils advocate those 41 people had to infect someone and whomever that someone is theyre indeed going to seem extremely unluckyThis is exactly what I wrotePeople who got infected back when there were only small number of sick people were very unluckyNot only that this guy additionally managed to do so during only two hours or got on a plane with one of the few infected Comparing it to the size of the city and the small exposure window he had he must have been extremely unlucky|0
Have open conversations with him but if people dont care and dont want to change you have to forgive them and move on otherwise you get brought down with them Dont leave your own sanity overly dependant on external variables that are subject to constant change as harsh as that may sound Ive learnt that in my life|0

Interestinga worker in the Life Care Center travelled to Wuhan Can you provide a link If that is true that would really be a breach of ethics I had assumed it was spread into the community from the original US case in Snohomish and had taken a hold there as viruses are wont to do in nursing homes|1
I would check with your hotel airline etc and see what their current stance is Id question them on the possibility of a refund or how they would work that due to the unfolding situation Then use your best judgement As a Floridian i wouldnt necessarily encourage coming Tourism is how this state survives and they are going to wait to the absolute last moment possible before announcing anything like an isolation quarantine zone like NY has to try to mitigate losses of those tourism dollars Our governor has made it clear he doesnt want to give us numbers of how many have been tested how many are in quarantine or how many have tested positive The Orange County mayor Jerry Demings statement is that we are open for business Disney is who publicly said they had some of their own employees in quarantine because they werent stopped or questioned at the orlando international airport after returning from Northern Italy Oh and we are heavens waiting room so we have a metric assload of old people who are believing this is a hoax Plus our grocery stores are pretty picked over from people panic buying i went to walmart last night and it looked like the store was going out of business cause those shelves were bare af Outside that the weather is nice Its already feeling like late springearly summer but without the daily afternoon downpours we usually get Gas prices are down so driving all over would be cheap as hell Fishing gear seems mostly untouched in walmart so im sure you could grab some gear and be out on a lake without a problem|1
The last sentence xD|1
Ok it is a good time to discuss something i havet see it in your first reply  maybe my faultBut i am still afraid to say you are wrong you cant prevent people to hospital by shut down transportations  when they are so sick They solved this overloaded  hospital  by build field hospital converted from exhibition hall and etc and redirection all mid patient into it|0

Perhaps they give a fuck but they want to reduce the impact it will have on them at a local scale Investors brokers etc all know the score but if they hold off talking about it as long as possible it helps keep a higher starting point when the effects actually start to impact Id rather start at 100 when impacts are felt than have the starting point dropped by speculation and fear mongering prices crash exceptionally quickly when they do its better to start as high as possible|0

Too bad Nurgles Rot isnt mortal|0
Good that its being studiedMost other respiratory viruses fall off as late spring and summer temps arrive and other Coronavirus have shown this pattern specifically Of course high temps harm transmission and low temps inhibit itNote that this data set does not include much higher temps that typically reduce infections a lot so its speculative to use this study into that range Instead we should rely upon existing understanding of respiratory viruses including human Coronavirus which fall off much faster in those summer months especiallyAlso Wuhan is on the colder side as China goes but had the most draconian controls placed That may be omitted variable bias that would cause an understatement of high temp less cases expressed in the data if not well controlled for and it would be hard to control for since that control level is basically an n of 1 w regards to testing vs climate variation|0
In basic optimization theory you usually have a minimization criteria that you aim for In other words you have some functions and boundaries and you say I want to make X as low as possible  In our case the variable we want to minimize is hospital capacity threshold reached So the timing is very dependent as you say|1

The companies likely dont have the money for that but governments sure do  Thats exactly what the governments in Asia did starting in January  They went to all their medical equipment and mask companies and threw cash at them and guaranteed purchase of everything they could make for a long long time  Its mind boggling that the US still hasnt done that yet|1

It is not very smart to trow up this bal if too many communities give this a go you will need more that luck we are living in a on demand system|1
Not necessarily The LCov variant yes But the milder SCov variant perhaps not Youd have to know how dangerous the strain is but if its truly much less virulent with weaker symptoms maybe its something that will run its course naturally|0

Lol|1
I recall when China did this everyone was like CCP is evil|0
Im aware there was a January 15th case  No ones talking about that  Im responding to someone whos suggesting that it has to be a less dangerous strain because the 50 year olds that have tested positive so far dont have pneumonia  Which as I already stated is a false assumption as the first 50 year olds tested just popped up|0
The virus doesnt just become multiple times more dangerous because it happens to be in Italy A lot of people will be flying under the radar due to their mild symptoms as already seen in China and Korea If those dont make it into the stats the stats go wild|0

Were looking at a situation where our government has decided to wildly diverge from the global response to the coronavirus  which includes a stated aim of the majority of the population eventually contracting a deadly virus which every other government in the world is trying to protect their whole population from People are responding to that very naturally and largely rationally by questioning why we are going down this path alone and why our government is openly telling us to expect many more loved ones to die How do you expect people to react to that|1
I held some hope until 2 days ago As I say the general public could not know the truth it would be mayhem I was holding out hope for a better response It is not what I was hoping too much riding the economy with Britain leaving the EU that is why we are all still at work business as normal Well done for standing up and being counted I did not care about looking crazy I know my close friends are prepared They have not done the irrational buy 3000 loo rolls they are ready to have to stay at home for a few weeks to help stop the spread of this virus which will claim our old and our weak|1

Dr Fair Im panicking because myself and several members of my family are highrisk  over40 with heart disease over70 with heart disease and over40 ER personnel  and I have a gradeschool child Im very frustrated with how the US government has responded to the outbreak I think that there will be very different mortality rates between places with undercapacity modern medical support 1 and places where modern medical support is overwhelmed by cases 7What do I do to prepare myself and protect my family and what can I do to influence public policy to stop the spread of this disease|1

I dated a woman once whose job was to sit in classrooms in one of the largest school districts in the country and observe and take notes  Why  Because the school was running an experiment on the children  Certain classes were flagged to receive new tech their teachers were trained to implement it in the classes etc  Think electronic devices and smart whiteboards etc  And other classes were flagged to NOT receive those  And the district was following the kids over the course of years and keeping track to see how different the groups outcomes were  I get why you might want that kind of data but I felt really outraged that the kids were being experimented on and no one had any opportunity to consent  And the worst part is that once they eventually rolled out school provided iPads for everyone it was a giant fiasco with unreliable glitchy software  All that experimenting on kids and no one bothered to make sure the software was up to snuff|0

Its even deeper than that Americans Actually value companiesdistributors in a Messiah like cult like fashion To the point they will support brands and make an already rich lil girl like Kylie Jenner even richer just because they like her hair color and baby mama statusEven US government operates in the interest of companies Obama Bush Trump all gave out bail outs like candy while our public infrastructure crumbles away into dust Our teachers are so worn out and underpaid I almost feel like half of them dont even givva shit about their class anymore Also its acceptable to shame them for doing anything in their own interest instead of my kids interest I legit heard ppl getting irritated about schools closing Tbh I hope the distance education thing kicks off teachers can get paid to work from home and ungrateful brats that dont even value education can be a burden to their own parents as it should beAmerican citizens dont even care about their own government at all it seems either When you talk to an American they wont say we have the best government No they say we are the best country They believe our country functions best with little to no government at all I mean dont get me wrong they will call out government for not doing this or that but in the same breath say government shouldnt have power cause its always corruptMany Americans think the government should only be qualified to  start wars and send their kids off to die provide babysitters that cant teach anything to their kids cause learning is indoctrination parents always knows the best information their children need and to provide money to retired people Everything else USA sees as unnecessary from prison systems to street sweepers I even heard Americans complaining about fire fighters how fire fighters fighting wild fires in CA are part of the Illuminati confirmed|0
Which imo is exactly why the US is limiting tests and has controlled and centralized the testing process thru CDC  If states and local health authorities were authorized to test we would see documentation of community spread which would cause panic buying civil unrest and economic impact|0

Even if they were honest we will not get real numbers at this pointThey are reporting only the cases that are confirmed to have nCov and China has limited capacity to test for the disease They can realistically only test a subset of people with how strained Wuhan is right nowThe claims of 10000  100000 infected though believable are still estimates and guesses rather than concrete numbers|0
Do the same for your view explain how Trump fucked up the test kits|0
Ohhh good question I was totally thinking about Aum Shinrikyo too I think from everything Ive read so far that Aum Shinrikyo was more actively trying to fuck shit up by making their own weapons Shincheonji seems to be more insidious to be honest Theyve been slowly bulding members in high places even the last Prime Minister was linked to them It seems like they are more of a group poised and willing to take advantage of naturally chaotic eventsId love to see some in depth comparisons though|1

The Shang dynasty founded around 1600 BC of the Yellow River valley in northern China is as far back as we have solid archaeological evidence and positive proof of the first written records Earlier than that history disintegrates into mythology But even if you accept the preceding mythical Xia dynasty as the start it takes you back only to around 2000 BCIn terms of age civilizations in other parts of the world precede China Writing systems in Egypt and Mesopotamia predate Chinese writing by a thousand years The worlds first city Uruk in modernday Iraq dates back seven thousand years Even in comparison to Europe China isnt that old Confucius life overlapped with those of Pythagoras and Socrates China was first unified in 221 BC a century after Alexander the Great had created the Hellenistic Empire and just a few centuries before the zenith of the Roman EmpireThree threeandahalf four millennia  surely all ancient enough Does it really matter that China doesnt have five thousand years of history Yes it does matter and not because its annoying to have this inaccuracy spouted ad nauseam as historical fact not to mention the hypocrisy of glorifying history yet so poorly preserving it The myth is important because of the inference that China is uniquely old and so deserves special consideration This has reallife consequences When dealing with China  whether trying to turn a profit or awaiting democratic reforms  the implication is you need to be more patient and just wait a little bit longer After all the country has five thousand years of historyChinese history is long and fascinating theres no need to spin it and its a shame to see it used by the government and media as an instrument of nationalism The implied superiority of such a long history begets a dangerous sense of entitlement And its just plain silly Imagine if we applied the logic of old civilizations deserve special treatment to Egypt and the modern Mesopotamian nations of Iraq and Iran places that actually do have five thousand years of history Imagine executives explaining Our joint venture in Cairo is losing money but we have to be patient  they built the pyramids fourandahalfthousand years ago Or picture political commentators urging caution along the lines of Cant push the Iranian government too hard for democratic reforms  they had cities when we were still living in cavesLazy writers continue to churn out falsehoods about Chinas glorious past and to contrast it against our own upstart cultures They paint hyperbolic vignettes juxtaposing Oriental sophistication with Western crudity silkrobed scholars sip tea and contemplate poetry while far away in darkest Europe the inhabitants run around in furs In a recent biography on Sinologist Joseph Needham author Simon Winchester contrasts the engineering masterpiece of a twothousandyearold Chinese irrigation waterworks with Westerners who still coated themselves in woad and did little more than gruntAs well as its sheer age China being the longest continuous civilization is often said to make it unique The idea of Chinese civilization as a monolithic unchanging entity stretching in an unbroken line through the millennia is another myth that colours perceptions of China past present and future Sometimes the falsehoods are not just quaint asides but the very foundations of narratives Martin Jacques 2009 bestseller When China Rules the World is a case in point Jacques regurgitates the line that China is special because of its antiquity and continuity and adds his own take on it China as a civilization state rather than a nation state He sees an ascendant China ruled by Confucian authoritarianism and as it becomes more powerful the reassertion of the ageold sense of superiority and a return to tributarystyle relationships with lesser nations This sort of commentary is demeaning to Chinese people turning them into passive victims of their history forever condemned to repeat it|1

Thank you for posting this Frankly I am confused seeing the government acting like that To give more context I am a Pole living in Scotland Hence I am in touch with my relatives living in my country of origin I am not sure if Poland is overdoing it by applying all the measures I would say better safe than sorryMy biggest concern is that current UK approach will backfire soon and somehow it resembles sir Chamberlains diplomacy which did not end wellI would like to highlight that I respect my host country and have avoided any criticism maybe apart from IR35 reform However this is not usual circumstances we are facing these days|1

These are simply numbers that reflect what happens if you assume that the Los Alamos Laboratory is correct in its estimation that the SARSCoV19 virus will spread in a manner that doubles every 24 days If you assume case one was on Jan 8 those are the numbersIt assumes no social distancing or super spreadersIf you assume the first case was Jan 15 which happened to be when the first confirmed case in the US arrived from Wuhan then the numbers shift forward one week such that 100 are infected by March 1617The world appears more messy than numbers and may not true up exactly for multiple reasons However if Los Alamos is correct these numbers are more right than wrong  Particularly given the long incubation period|0

I doubt the number of infected is correct Remember we are super behind in testing Most likely it spreads at a much greater rate and therefore the rate of hospitalization is actually lower BUT this doesnt change the fact that hospitals will most likely still get overwhelmed|1

If anything youre agreeing with the posters sentiment these are average people who have decided to become experts in a potentially incredibly dangerous career Nerves of steel indeed and almost impossible to stop People who can have and will continue to fail and persevere in the face of pandemic I agree with your message about front line workers but I dont understand why you would disagree with above poster|0

 Sorry are you telling me that even WITH insurance you will still have to stump up that money Yeap That 20000 premium most familiesemployers are paying every year still comes with a high deductible of 510000 per family each year that you have to pay Its insane especially when compared to the taxes people pay in other countries the US gets ripped off for ROI on health dollars spentGood luck if you have a serious or ongoing medical issue here When my youngest child was born she had some health issues so we ended up having to meet the 5000 deductible three times in 12 months the first year I changed jobs in October and then we hit it again in January of the second year Meanwhile back in my country of birth New Zealand my family pay less in total taxes than what my insurance plan costs Its madness|0

No one seems to be pointing out that in a wide spread outbreak even if only 10 need hospitalized thats still high enough to overwhelm medical systems    Overwhelming the system will lead to higher death rates    So its not just about the death rates we are currently seeing but how fast it spreads     We should get a better idea in a few days|0
I dont have sources Im just basing this off my understanding of the articles and journals Ive seen posted here Sorry if I didnt make that clear enough in my post One thing I have seen a lot of is the terminology differences between asymptomatic and very mild symptoms seems to be interchangable Pretty much again just from what I understand these are people that are experiencing symptoms that are comparable to seasonal allergies or even milderAlso these numbers could be wrong and are definitely just stated as estimates in the articles I think mostly because everyone other than SK is really focusing testing on just those sick and needing treatment at the momentEdit going to add a few broad sources that definetily dont match what Ive said exactly but are along the lines of what I understandhttpsnypostcom2020031786ofpeoplewithcoronavirusarewalkingaroundundetectedstudysays|0

Theres no guarantee that they gain any immunitySince we dont know enough about the Immune response and we are certain that many individuals will not gain immunity after first infection So the percentage required to be infected is closer to 8090  population unacceptable morbidity and mortality in pursuit of a unicorn UK  herd immunityBritish Soceity of Immunology There are many unknowns in how the SARSCoV2 virus interacts with the human immune system and how this might play into current scenarios For example we dont yet know if this novel virus will induce longterm immunity in those affected as other related viruses do not Therefore it would be prudent to prevent infection in the first placeMatt Hancock says Herd Immunity is not the goal of the UK response to Corona Virus todaydirectly  contradictingBoris and his Chief Scientific advisor defending the UK position of achieving Herd Immunityhttpswwwftcomcontent38a81588650811eab3f3fe4680ea68b5 yesterday|1

In vivo HQ has long been a standard immunosuppressant for many auto immune diseases with a mild side effect profile But this immunosuppressive effect takes months to appear When a pt is initiated on HQ or has a dose change the approach is to reassess symptoms in 3 months to see if it has helped symptoms HQ is a very slow subtle immunomodulationThanks thats a relief to hearWhat do you think about the older studies they site where chloroquine appeared to actually exacerbate some viruses Stuff like thisThe case of chikungunya virus CHIKV is of specific interest chloroquine showed promising antiviral activity in vitro Coombs et al 1981 Delogu and de Lamballerie 2011 but was shown to enhance alphavirus replication in various animal models Maheshwari et al 1991 Roques et al 2018 Seth et al 1999 most probably because of the immune modulation and antiinflammatory properties of chloroquine in vivo Connolly et al 1988 Katz and Russell 2011 Savarino et al 2003 In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay the cellular immune response leading to an incomplete viral clearance Roques et al 2018|1

welp it already seems not to work like were in day 86 later actually but we dont know how much since 1 infected on 8th december 1st suspicious case was administed to the hospital in Wuhan with pneumonia already i can find the article i took it from if required but cant remember from the top of my head read shitloads of them previous days and its already not the case this model shows more then 25 millions cases each day worldwide we have 86k in total officially and 500k of them needing hospital care also daily this couldnt be missed like at alli mean even Italy where weve seen the latest outbreak for the moment wasnt flooded with patients with viral pneumonia and still actually isnt noone even suspected it was around before that first guy was almost accidentaly tested his friend that returned from China who was basically the reason he got tested was negative if it was like this model shows they wouldve noticed huge increase in outofhospitals viral pneumonias long beforetbh we all wouldve noticedso no this model likely doesnt work|0

Wouldnt be able to trace it now too many infections in Korea however I do think theres a good chance she wasnt infected on 119120 and she picked it up another way in Korea after that  Another user posted today a hypothesis that a ChineseKorean caregiver could have possibly gone to China for Chinese New Years bringing that back to the Daenam Hospital where she worked which went on to the cult where it blew up  That puts the ChineseKorean patient zero starting the uncontrolled spread in Korea starting well after 125 maybe 128 or later|1

There is SOME free testing although it depends on your circumstances and locationFor one thing a shortage in diagnostic supplies means that many people arent receiving tests You have to present symptoms to qualify If you dont receive a test but do get screened that qualifies as a doctors visit  not a coronavirus test That qualifies for a copayIts not even waiving copays or deductibles for services you need to get tests  emergency visits doctors etc noted Sabrina Corlette a professor at Georgetown Universitys Health Policy Institute Its well waive copays for the tests which is the lab serviceThe only place you can get tested in a lot of communities is still the hospital emergency room department so thats an emergency visitThere are a lot of issues So lets even say you manage to get a free test maybe you need to pay thousands for hospital treatment You may also need to meet the deductible first depending on your companyplan|0

Im not aware of any studies looking at particulate matter air pollution as a kind of vector for pathogen transmission but there is a pretty welldescribed process in the literature where many types of air pollution coarse and fine particulate matter ozone etc can irritate and inflame lung tissue which increases the likelihood of infection after exposure These effects tend to be amplified in people with underlying respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD|1

Our most rural state wyoming already has multiple cases  Surprising even to me Im from there Im pretty sure the disease will infect most of the USA its just a question of how fast   Personally I think trying to slow it down is futile and counter productive in many ways  But Im just a contrarian like that I guess   I cant stand groupthink|1

Just to expand on this this patient was related to the previous confirmed Muskokaregion case of a 70yo man reporting to RVH in Barries Had no travel history but had recent in contact with a recentlydeceased 77yo patient the patient mentioned hereThis is why they were tested posthumouslyPretty crazy that otherwise a 77up had died of a respiratory disease but would have certainly tested negative for flu and they just 1 let them die without aggressive nCoV treatments and 2 I presume allowed them to stay outside of isolation supposedly taking visitors without sufficient contact precautionsThis is allaround super fucked up|0

The UK logic which I dont support is that Korea cannot stay shut down forever Once they reopen school and ease restrictions the same number of people will get infected UK wants to have restrictions  social distancing but keep the economy running at a higher rate Im not confident itll work But it is true that Korea cant stay like this forever I live here so there is a massive question mark about how long this can go on The virus is still spreading outside Daegu and new clusters coild easily spring up So Korea is far from in the clear|1

Its just a different way of not understanding exponential growth  Usually people just think of it as fast but its not  Its really slow at first  Theres also a huge lag  And then on top of it the total lack of testing means we wont find out when its going to hit till it hitsIm gonna guess very very loosely based on the Italy has trended that well be seeing about 520 deaths a day by next weekend in both Washington and NY  The medical system wont be overwhelmed by that point   But if cases at that point are up to 5001000 new a day theyll be getting overwhelmed by the week after that  But Im guessing were about 253 weeks behind Italian type numbers|0

You havent been following this virus much and are showing lack of understanding of how this virus functionsJust 2 weeks ago nobody could fathom Italy having community spread but here we are The majority of mild symptoms and asymptomatic transmission capability lags the time before you can discover community spreadOnce you have cases of people that arrive to the hospital and die in a few days see Italy you pretty much already have community spread underway|0

seems on point considering SARS at the end of the outbreak was 96 and they are fairly similar all things considered only Corona is more infectious and has a much longer incubation period where its also infectiousSARS CFR during the earlymid stages of its outbreak were also along the 2545 linethis is like deja vu|1

Usualy when large scale disasters happen governments release funds to reimburse those affected Insurance companies would go bankrupt otherwise leaving everyone without insurance something wed all like to avoidSecondly the WHO does not care about your insurance policy at all The WHO uses the term pandemic when countries should need to switch from focusing containment of the disease to mitigation Like the seasonal flu Impossible to contain it so mitigation is the only option For now most countries should still focus on containing it firstly and mitigation comes only secondThe term pandemic means nothing for you and me we are not the intended audience On top of managing and tracking the disease the WHO and all governments are trying to manage the confused scared and stressed people Not because they are evil or because they want to deceive you or anything but because they and medical personel can do their best work when people remain calm arent panic hoarding basic necesities or riotingI personally get rather stressed out by this situation and thats normal Maybe even good Im aware of the danger and can thus change my behavior to limit the possible spread of the disease But I now try to limit my news intake about the virus a bit for my own sanity Getting too stressed out when the outbreak in my country belgium is still relatively small doed nothing good for my health hahaTake care|0
 Such a fuck up like seriously I cant believe so many people argued that keeping the people on the ship was a good idea Just pure madnessFrom the scientific standpoint it was a fantastic idea|1

Im hoping the fact that 2 MPs were potentially exposed to it concentrates some minds in the UK Its just a pity they were Labour MPs including my MP if the Gov saw some of their own party at risk they may do something about Edit for clarity that sounds incredibly harsh on the two MPs who are self quarenteening Of course I hope they have not been exposed and dont get sick I do stand by my belief that the Parliamenty Tory party wont give a damn about anything except themselves however|1

Thanks for the great answer Exactly thats our western problem of social consciousness even sick people wouldnt think safety first and they would keep on going with their lives Thats not how we can slow the spread we need people to stay at home at the faintest sore throat Today in Paris even though gatherings of more than 100 people are forbidden people are out protesting The French exception|0

Nothing yet Im not sure where you live Im not trying to spread panic or anything Im just being realistic about St Louis Were always at or near the top of the list for most dangerous cities in America sadly Murders carjackings robberies etc here all the time  It sucks We already have a shortage of cops here too  So if things get bad like hospitals are overwhelmed cops are sick so less cops on the street schools are closed whos going to keep social order here  I suppose the National Guard could come in Maybe it wont even get that bad Im really not trying to be a fear monger but we did have riots looting  arson here a few years ago Wouldnt shock me if it happens again|0
Its pretty specific though it says high concentrations of aerosol in a closed environment over a long time so planes trains cruise ships obviously Not sure how it would be in a pharmacy Its a big place and in general my wife washes her hands between counting out meds to avoid cross contamination and killing someone Hopefully shell be ok She has some health issues so getting Covid19 could be bad|0

Oh youre for sure not wrong But as weve seen from past events and as China and Pooh by extension has no doubt expressed any information or actions that are even remotely embarrassing could make things very difficult for the WHO to do their jobs which is saving lives Im speculating here of courseIf this head of the WHO has to say and do some distasteful things to keep the lines of communication open and frankly to help keep his people safe in China then God help him The stakes are too high in my opinion to go calling out China for being bastards when theyre going to be bastards regardless He has a duty to save as many lives as possible and he has a duty to his employees actually in China or heading there To make himself feel better and to look better in the pages of history by taking a stand against China and to hold strong on whats right and true does absolutely no one any good here Seems to me that you have exactly the right person for the job here So he has to lick some booty hole so he has to make Pooh the DICKtator feel good and have his ego inflated maybe thats not so bad when so many lives hang in the balanceNow obviously Im painting the WHO and its upper management in a pretty gratuitous light Im not here to say that the WHO is a blameless organization because theyre certainly not however in this one instance for this one case I think a little slack can be awarded|1
Yea I understand but the rate of spread means that well be seeing more deaths in coming days You also have to remember in the US people arent being tested so there could be deaths happening that are being attributed to other causes|1
You can thank Biden for that httpstheinterceptcom20200107joebidenstudentloans|1
buy bloomberg terminal then pay thousands of dollars a year stock market just crashed so use it to your advantage when it goes back up then BAM profitBut honestly there is no way to bypass it that shit is on straight fucking lockdown with fingerprint readers and a bunch of other shit Main way to bypass it is being in college as most colleges have a bloomberg terminal that they let you use for free|0

Hey thereI know its really tough right now but you can get through this You are going to be ok I can definitely relate a little to how youre feeling as Im 24 and have asthma I did a little wikipediaing and it seems like a broncospasm is kind of like an asthma attack The virus is also already in the city where I live so its definitely been causing me a lot of anxiety too But theres a couple things Ive been keeping mind to try and stay positive1 Its rare for someone our age to have a severe case of this disease Its even more rare like really really rare for someone of our age to die from this disease Were talking small fractions of a single percentage point of cases here The VAST VAST majority like 999 percent of people our age are going to be fine Us included2 While we dont have a ton of information on this yet an early clinical study showed no link at all between having asthmaCOPD and increased risk of catching the disease or having a severe case You sound like youre already doing a great job of getting prepared for this Thats awesome because being aware and following basic hygiene recommendations really does cut down on your risk of catching it Just keep it up and try your best to keep that anxiety in check Do you have access to a doctor or any counselingtherapy services|1

Cruise ships have notoriously bad air circulation The virus isnt quite airborne but aerosol particles from infected bowel movements have been shown to spread through linked septic systems in apartment complexes It doesnt matter if theyre quarantined in their cabins at the moment because the virus is already traveling freely within the shipAnd while the crew members may be younger on average they are overexposed from interacting with all of the passengers  theres just more opportunities for them to get infected|0

Is it just me or is this pretty telling that hospitals are the ones that spread shit They always talk about the public doing more but Im sorry why the fuck are health care workers getting sick The amount of money in the healthcare industry and the impact of spreading germs youd think theyd fix that rather than pointing fingers I guess I answered myself|0
Good points Im in the PPE industry I actually made this account not for the virus but for the Taal volcano explosion in the Philippines in mid January because people needed mask information at that time If anyone really needs supplies in bulk I have legit websitecompany credentials Im not going to post them publicly though|1
Im also a Beijing expat currently exiled in the US Im not sure what to think and am definitely interested in your thoughts Two questions There are officially 418 cases in Beijing with 297 recovered and 8 deaths Everyone on this sub seems to assume China is underreporting the numbers or undertesting but even if thats true there clearly arent millions of cases in Beijing Im in contact with a lot of people in Beijing including expats People are taking precautions there are selfquarantines and gate checks etc but many people are still going to work and living their lives Is China better at managing the spread of the disease outside of Hubei or am I missing something For the moment Beijing seems better than Milan or Seoul How will we know when to go back to China The US State Dept lists China as Level 4 Do Not Travel They could have singled out certain regions but they listed the entire mainland Korea and Italy are only Level 3 but seem to be having much more spread Even if the disease starts to ebb how quickly will the State Dept lower that travel warning Are you going to go back before theyve lowered the warning level|1

Things being promoted out of P3 to P4 certainly can happen Generally either right away when a new organism was found to me originally misclassified and a lot of people are dying or if a change is made to it and it is deemed to be substantially more hazardous than the orginal forms There is no way at all that they would just trust you to get rid of it in that case it would be an every plate and every vial accounted for and destroyed in front of them sort of deal It is a great excuse to use for a movie though and I could see it being hand waved off without too much trouble|1

The basic infrastructure still exits in the complete lockdown in China  grocery stores supermarkets pharmacies etcs are required to open Community workers are organized and working full time to provide necessary services Hotels food hygiene products etc are provided to healthcare workers for free Believe me if the government wants to do it they will find a way to do it Of course its a complete lock down and it will impact the economy That depends if the government values the people more than the economy am I right |1

im not going to engage in hypotheticalsYou are hypothesising that measures that are currently effective at containing the virus will remain so a year two years from nowYou are hypothesising that the best approach is containment Until the pandemic is over we wont know that for certainYou are hypothesising that world wide containment is possible  No country has so far prevented this escaping their bordersIf you are talking about the future in any way you are hypothesising or theorising or assessing or what ever you want to call it  The past even the recent past is only a guide to what will happen in the futureNo we dont we have evidence of how to break transmission and reverse the virusYes  But your belief that those measures will remain effective in the future is a hypothesis not fact  If I had no wives yesterday and one wife today it would be foolish to extrapolate and say that I will have two wives tomorrow  Even the recent past is a very poor guide to the futureThe hypothesis containment measures used in other countries will continue to be effective in those countries and would be effective in other countries is an assessment which has a probability associated with it  And my contention is that the probability of that hypothesis being true is very lowWere both theorising  Im just honest enough to admit it and use the language of uncertainty   You want to pretend that you know the future|1

There are literally multiple trials being claimed to start advancing towards a vaccine now but okMy comment didnt state a time period so I dont know why you keep saying a year from now or maybe then like it negates my comment I just said in general not something I could imagine signing up to do and Ive been in clinical trials before This is an absolutely new virus there have been some signs pointing to it potentially having characteristics of antibody dependent enhancement owing to reports of reinfections and a paperhttpswwwmedrxivorgcontent1011012020021820024364v1 I just read about T cell depletion in COVID19 common in ADE pathologies owing to the fact you need CD8 T cells to prevent ADE ADEs are notoriously difficult to create effective and safe vaccines for Check out the crises of the dengue vaccine for example which the WHO has recalled their recommendation for and now advises that no one who has never had dengue fever ever receive because it can be deadly We didnt get to study SARS  MERS on humans effectively because the SARS outbreak only lasted 2 years and MERS cases were few and far between Theres just too much we dont know about this virus yet for me to feel comfortable experimenting with my own bodyHence why I said couldnt pay me to do the vaccine trials but Im glad someone will Also never had a flu shot and Ive never had the flu Tdap polio and MMR is all I need thanks But I appreciate your concern for my health and your  condescending  fucking  smiley faces |1

Agreed Some people have wagered that Italys old population is to blame for its staggering fatality rate 5 but I think reinfection might be a significant contributing factor that is the virus gets more rather than less virulent and longterm immunity is minimal The fact that a harrowing number of otherwise healthy Chinese doctors died from the virus could be supporting evidence  what they had in common given their profession was continuous exposure to the virus during its emergence and high likelihood of at least one reinfection|0

There are no mild cases of this virus itself afaik but it takes around 10 days to start shutting down your lungs and immune system which requires intensive care and can be fatal A young healthy person can beat it before it progresses to the critical stage some have beaten it in days and the initial stages are quite harmless theyll just have a mild fever cough maybe headache or brief diarrheavomiting like a mild bug Critical stage hits rapidly within 24 h once you have progressed that far though|1

Another worthy goal of containment is it can also help to buy time to find better treatments or new therapiesIn your scenario do the people that require hospitalization to survive get that chance Not unless you slow the spread as much as possible Say it takes around 60 of the population getting the virus to achieve herd immunity That still leaves a good 8 million people in the UK that will experience worse than mild systems Probably require some form of hospitalization What kind of time frame are we talking aboutWhen it comes to making sure that those are greates risk are quarantining Is the UK prepared to or capable of quarantining over 12 million people over age 60 for the next 3 monthsWould you achieve any better result trying to identify those at greatest risk for long term more than 2 months quarantine from the general population than you would continuing with containment mitigation strategiesAnd at this point we dont even know if the virus will mutate like cold  flu becoming a seasonal illness|1

You flatten the curve by social distancing That includes things like cancellation of mass gatherings a shut down of mass transit closure of nonessential workplaces closure of academic institutions and community centres and so on These are the things other countries are doingEncouraging people to selfquarantine for 7 days if they have either a new cough or fever is not going to do much to the curve The government is right that whatever is done must be sustainable but they have done effectively nothing as of yet|1
People dont get off their asses when they see that Trump is presidentBut when they and their loved ones cant get the vaccine they need it will change into a different story  You saw panic buying  Watch the political lynchings that will happen when people see that it is a serious disease and cant get vaccine  It is already starting to happen very subtly  Bernies healthcare is starting to look better  Bidens nothing will change is starting to look dangerous  Trumps it not my fault is starting to look obscene  I am not saying this  The polls are saying this  The GOP is allowing its base to be killed off with false information  Only Fox News is realizing that if you kill off your base they wont have viewership  GOP doesnt realize that the people who make their meals are coming in sick to work the people who serve them at restaurants are coming in sick to work the people who clean their houses are coming in sick to work  The common thread with todays GOP is they are penny wise and pound foolish  They are shortsighted and dont think things through  Yeah sure you can be wealthy for now but it always changes|0

What I used was the worldometer numbers and might have screwed the math up it was late should be 59 My bad Iran Italy and WuhanHubei suggest the virus was spreading there way before detection Lower CFR outside those areas suggests this is a lot more mild than its optimistically  made out to be or pessimistically about to get a lot worse everywhere |0
I work at a restaurant in your exact same situation and I was absolutely TERRIFIED when two customers coming to pick up their food coughed and looked so sick PEOPLE shouldve just stayed at home and do a nocontact delivery thats available on some apps instead of going out and Freaking risk other peoples health during times like these even if youre thinking its just a normal cough|0

I am from Austria and hell I can say this is right now so not necessary We do have infected people here but we also try to get those home who are from abroad The ambulance acts fast and the Seuchenschutzbehrde takes cases seriously Right now if you got no letter or visit from them you are probably fine though there are sure some dark numbers but as austrians mostly have their tier groups this wont get epidemic without knowledge that fast At least in especially this supermarket which is build to have negative pressure air flow is probably not a corona spreading hot spot But well this are just thoughts about austrians condition I could be wrong but thats the local fell about Though some people just dont trust in technology people need to just follow basic rules to prevent spread Everything else is on management now hope there are no stupid decisions made|0

You will only know there is a problem when hospital cases increase Healthcare authorities have accepted that this is how it will play out You wont hear any official announcements about that though to avoid public outcryNot to be a fearmongerer but by that logic it could be happening right now right  I have no idea whats going on in my local hospital I went to a walkin a few days ago and it was packed as usual in flu season with some visable symptoms of pneumonia and fever  I wasnt sitting comfortably to say the least|0
But dont you think its entirely possible and probably even likely that the reason the numbers arent going up much is because tests arent being done at high enough levels Either this or they are being done and the numbers are not being reported Either way it feels like there are probably way more actual cases than the numbers being reported on the media based on what we see in other countries including our neighbors South Korea I mean I dont know all the details but it seems that Japan had similar levels of exposure to the virus that SK had and SK has been way more diligent in there actions to test and stop it and yet they reported WAY more cases than Japan has So if Japan had similar number of cases as SK at the beginning and DIDNT take the actions that SK did you could almost imagine that Japan has EVEN MORE actual cases Its just we dont see those numbers being reported And obviously the government has huge incentive aka Olympics to make it seem like all is okay But in reality its probably NOT I mean people are still going out to town in bars and walking around like nothings much different but in reality the virus could be a real threat every where we go at this point Its a scary thought as someone living in that environment|1

This is assuming youre in the US but you might not be if youve never heard of a 401k I would think most countries have something similar Its basically an investment account given through your employer and the money you put into it comes out before taxes Youre not taxed on the money you contribute or gains until you withdrawl and you cant access it until youre 65 except in certain circumstances Most employers offer some kind of match up to a couple percent of what you invest as well which is basically free money Thats why most financial advice will tell you to at least contribute up to your employer matchBut they give you the option of deciding how your money is invested By default your money usually goes into portfolios that change their aggressiveness based on how close you are up retirement or you can manage them directly If you are American I highly recommend reading the book I posted before you enter the workforce Its written for people that arent trying to be investment bankers it started as letters to his daughter He explains the different kinds of accounts and where you should be putting your money A little financial literacy is important|1

Please avoid offtopic political discussionsOur policy on political posts is as followsThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion we therefore wish to limit it The line is inevitably blurred but we use a distinction between policy and politics Policy is fine politics is better posted elsewhere News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy they will be removed Likewise editorialized headlines whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned|1

Death rateSo far this flu season about 005 of people who caught the flu have died from the virus in the US according to CDC data The death rate for COVID19 appears to be higher than that of the flu In the study published Feb 18 in the China CDC Weekly researchers found a death rate from COVID19 to be around 23 in mainland China Thats much higher than the death rate linked to flu which is typically around 01 in the US according to The New York Times Even so the death rate for COVID19 varied by location and an individuals age among other factors For instance in Hubei Province the epicenter of the outbreak the death rate reached 29 in other provinces of China that rate was just 04 In addition older adults have been hit the hardest The death rate soars to 148 in those 80 and older among those ages 70 to 79 the COVID19 death rate in China seems to be about 8 its 36 for those ages 60 to 69 13 for 50 to 59 04 for the age group 40 to 49 and just 02 for people ages 10 to 39 Nobody 9 and under has died of this coronavirus to date|0

I find it hard to see the impact when it has yet to reach my area I understand the numbers mostly and that its likely going to go even further downhill soon but the emotional connection isnt really there It has come scarily close to my rural Canadian town which has a surplus of older folks so once it gets here which its likely to things could go real bad We only have one relatively major hospital for a fairly large area so once this thing hits its going to become swamped|0

News media isnt a monolith but you can trust news stories from major outlets like National Geographic PBS NewsHour NPR ProPublica STAT News The Washington Post The New York Times The Guardian Science Magazine Nature News and many others The best journalism tries to objectively convey what is happening as it happens Early on we made the decision to cover the outbreak with occasional deep dives because our readers seem to appreciate the 10000foot view rather than an individual piece about every single updateThere is a lot that we dont know about this outbreak and my favorite stories make mention of that reality The news can make mistakes because journalists are human but the overarching goal is accuracy|1

It wasnt exactly leaky toilets Although Im sure there were plenty of thoseSee in a normal house your drain pipe from the sinks showers and floor traps would be separated from the toilet sewage drain pipes You also have Utraps in the drain line filled with water creating an air locks that stop air from the drains being pushed up your sinks and floor trapsIn this apartment they cut costs by having the sink and floor trap drain pipes and sewage share the same line Not only that make Utraps were ineffective because they had gone dry So when patient 0 of apartment complex had diarrhea the farticles from his sewage could freely find its way up other apartment units sinks and floor traps Thus infecting 40 of the block he was inhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC539564|0

A regular surgical mask wont help much The reason is because the sides of the mask are not sealed If you have particles floating in front of your face and you inhale the airflow will be primarily around the mask and not filtered through the mask as one assumes since that is the path of least resistance If you want true protection you need a n95 maskA surgical mask will help prevent spread if YOU have it but will be minimally effective in preventing you from contracting if you are exposed to itThere is an argument to tape the top bottom and sides of the surgical mask down that is not as good as n95 but will offer you more protection than the almost no protection offered from a regular surgical mask This will also only offer limited if any protection due to the sizing of the weave of your mask viral particles are extremely small and will probably get sucked right through the material like trying to screen dust through a chain linked fence N95 offers much smaller particulate protectionSource am a doctor and deal with infectious diseases every day|0
And here we have the issue that you dont realise such as that if youre going to inhale a cloud of contaminated particles that blocking 10 of them or 50 of them of 95 of them or 99 of them doesnt make much difference in practice for average joe walking around as youre usually either going to be infected or not whether youre wearing a mask or notThis is why in practice medical professionals wearing surgical masks are about as likely to be infected as when theyre wearing n95sYou went on that whole tangent without realising that you havent realised how the dynamics of becoming infected actually works and what it means in practice by blocking 95 of particlesAs Ive already said to you the problem is that you dont understand the context of what youre appealing toWearing an n95 mask doesnt make any difference to some twit bumbling around in the street and going to shops Thats not how the dynamics of being infected actually works You just look stupid wearing it|0

Corona is starting to sound like the ultimate virus in terms of spreading Absolutely crazy terrifying how well it spreads|0
You probably wont see a lot of mortality until the infection rate goes log When that happens the whole demographic of the population becomes exposed including those most likely to die from it It may also be the case that the dose of the virus that causes the infection may correlate with its lethality Once the epidemic becomes widespread the environmental viral burden will skyrocket You might have one chance in 500 of getting infected if you sat next to one person on a plane who is infected However if youre on a plane with 300 infected people your chances might be 1 in 3A high environmental burden of the virus also makes PPE much less useful because your entire person can be covered in virus So unless you practice meticulous donning and doffing technique and do so in a clean virusfree environment youre going to get infected from the virus that lands on your skin or clothing under the PPE This is why you see people treating Ebola in the field being sprayed head to toe in disinfectant before they doff their PPE Its also why rodent colonies have disinfectant track mats to prevent a virus from being brought into vivarium on the feet of the staff even though they have just donned clean shoe covers These are the kinds of precautions you have to take to protect mice against plain old influenza So you cant extrapolate from low viral burden conditions to high viral burden ones This is one of the reasons why epidemics may increase in virulence as the number of infected people in the community increases dramatically|0

Theres little reporting on it because since SARS media companies have learned that pandemics require the opposite of their usual procedures Normally dramatic news gets people clicking and clicks mean advertisers get views and people buy shitPandemics are the opposite The more sensationalist you are the less people want to go out and shop for consumer goods Regardless of advertising Pandemic reporting hurts sponsors So the media is keeping it quietneutral Theres no conspiracy just money|0

Incubation of ebola is similar to this illness just FYI and the first on set of symptoms where very similar to influenza And no thats not the main factor that caused Ebola to spread less it was also atleast partly because it was located in much more rural areas compared to Wuhanim not that concerned about asymptomatic carriers because its not very dangerous an illness Also the intial screening tests were flawed the tests are now much more effective This is literally old news now|1

We dont know what its going to doSARSCOV the one that broke out on 2002 pretty much disappeared after it cooled offMERSCOV which broke out in 2012 never really went global The biggest difference between SARSCOV2 and the other ones is how easy it is to spread SARSCOV and MERSCOV dont spread as easily as SARSCOV2 doesThe main reason why this virus exploded like it did is that we dont have any immunities to it and spreads very easily Over time our immune systems will start to adapt to it and itll adapt to us and the rate of infection will decrease When a virus mutates it doesnt fully change there are still parts that can be identified by our immune systems What tends to change is how a virus attaches to a cell It might use one receptor then evolve to use another after the hosts body adjusts to the virus|1

Im surprised that the standards are still so stringent in Alberta given the amount of tests performed I thought they had moved on to sentinel testing as well But maybe they are being strict regarding travel history and less so on symptoms or perhaps most of the tests are related to the confirmed casesBut youre right it doesnt make sense to be so limiting The worst part is that people who have travelled internationally are unlikely to have infected other Canadians since they were abroad until recently So we are currently in this weird situation where were almost exclusively testing the people who are the least likely to have spread the virus in the country|0

This is completely right Also if youre comparing numbers the oftcited 01 mortality rate for a bad flu year is also a Case Fatality Rate  Nobody exhaustively checks every contact in the population for flu the way Korea is doing for COVID19 so the flus 01 is also only a percent of cases tracked by the medical system ie someone going to their doctor So that stat is missing a lot of mild flus as well and trying to estimate the number of mild cases and compare that fatality rate to the flu isnt an applestoapples comparison|0

We have 6 health ministers in Belgium for 10 million ppl this is insaneThey act like its a bad flu I wonder what will happen in 1 or 2 weeks when the hospitals will be full France is being way more realistic its crazy Plus they only test people who have been in contact with ppl coming back from Italy so there is actually way more cases that go incognito and the coronavirus is spreading quietly until there are no more beds in hospitals|0

These trips are what actually prompted the US to think about and develop plans for continuity of government in case he didnt come back Before that if a president died it was kind of a shit show until someone took charge Its what led to the development of government bunkers for high ranking officials sites for their families because most senators said they wouldnt go without them and led to mobile command centers like Air Force 1 The only time the continuity of government protocols has ever been implemented in the US was during 911 Bush was basically at the mercy of protocol and couldnt do a thing about it Kind of crazy if you think about it|0

Literally every country has had ages to prepare But every country has made the exact same mistake which is to churn out nothing but optimism until it was too late because economies must be kept running To beat a virus with a oneweek incubation period we need to act like its two weeks later If we act based on the data we see today the virus is already one week ahead of us and we are just playing catchupWhen the news reports the first case in any country most people who are morons think oh just one case no biggie They dont realise that in Italy and Korea there was a time when there was also just one case Because of the long incubation period the appearance of one case inevitably means that there are already other cases that have not developed symptoms yet The other problem is that people dont think exponentially This has been the case in almost every single countryIf  the virus wins it will be thanks to the stupidity and arrogance of mankindEdit Changed that to almost every single country Indeed Vietnam and Singapore have handled it well I was referring to Western countries and u should have been more clear|0

This is ignores mathematical reality though people keep talking about flattening the curve but in the vast majority of the world healthcare systems are already at or very near capacityLets do some math while looking at ireland small low population ruralish Ireland has 4 million peopleSay the virus can be limited to 1 tenth of 1 percent with strong lockdown measures That gives us 4000 cases 20 need hospitalisation Thats 800 in hospitals sounds good  manageable right until you realise that the country currently only has 255 ICU beds and again 90 of them are currently in use So the system is still going to become incredibly overwhelmed and will need to start looking to have field hospitals or mattresss on the floor or whatever to fight it Is it manageable Maybe but it would put incredible strain on a strained systemAnd remember thats at 01 infected evenly across the community The only way to get such a low number would be drastic measures that are going to fuck the economySo the plan is to go at this pace for what 1000 months Or more realistically until a vaccine is found so 912 months at best Fuck the economy and still have incredible strain on the system for 1 while year is the current planThats a terrible plan At least the UKs approach of letting it run through the young and able who have like a 02 hospitalisation rate while taking measure to protect the vulnerable doesnt fuck the country for a year Like I dont understand what the current plans goals are Like most nations can not realistically flatten the curve to the point that their systems wont be overwhelmed without completely shutting their nations down for the next 36 months Is that the current alternative to herd immunity I mean both plans suck but at least one will bring this crisis to an end sooner and takes a more honest approach of the powers western governments actually hold over their citizens lives|0

I know many people disagree with this but I really think limited price gouging should be legal say 510X standard prices  The reason for this is absent government mandated rationing and supply chain it is the most effective way to prevent hoarding  Secondly it is effectively impossible to prevent price gouging people know it is illegal but do it anywaysWhen a 36 pack of toilet paper only costs 10 it is easy for a person to buy it just in case  Even if they already have a mostly full 36 pack at home at that point the extra 36 isnt even a necessity but a luxury  However if the same pack is 100 most people even wealthy ones are going to stop and think do I really need an extra 36 rolls of toilet paper  The answer may be I already have enough or I only need 4 rolls either way hoarding reduced which means that more people get toilet paper which lowers prices and reduces hoarding  Also if you know the price is going jump day before the crisis hits you are much more likely to stock up on supplies in daysweeks before thus smoothing out the strain on the supply chainSecondly price gouging allows both third parties and manufactures to do expensive things to increase supply in times of crisis  A toilet paper manufacture might start paying a lot of overtime and hire temps to run their factories 247 in the daysweeks leading up to a crisis  This might double the per roll costs to manufacture because of inefficiencies from temps and overtime or less time for repairs  They might even keep an old manufacturing line mothballed instead of selling it for scrap so they can spin up more capacity on a short time frame  Finally they are would now be able to pay to store a large supply buffer in the weeks before a crisis All of these things could be accomplished instead by regulation mandating spare capacity forcing manufactures to operate at a loss during a crisis probably they get compensated by the government and per person limits on purchases  That last one is likely politically impossible to implement in the USA  To be effective it would need to a national database tied to individuals otherwise people are just going to go through the check line many times or go to different stores  As such not only do you now need an ID and a internet connection to purchase TP the government now has a database on how much TP everyone buys during a crisis  Also because this system isnt normally used it is unlikely to work smoothly when activated many stores would just not do it thus requiring you to divert resources from the crisis to enforcementFor the above reasons price gouging is a better solution than strict regulation and while I think price gouging is a worse idea than everyone voluntarily only buying as much as they need  The latter isnt actually a choice that we can collectively make  So that leave price gouging as the best solution  I might not like the idea of 3roll TP I even think it is unfair to the poor but as a person of reason I must accept logical results of my deductions|0

It baffles me why I keep reading western countries shame mask wearers I guess cause its the norm in most Asian countries including mine if youre having flu wear a mask if youre riding motorbike wear a mask if youre walking around with lots of cars around wear a mask if youre allergic to dust wear a mask I see my friends and me myself wear masks when we have bad flu coughing and sneezing since I was in primary school In fact in here if youre coughing or sneezing a lot and youre not wearing mask people are gonna be irked theyre gonna keep a good distance while talking to you and ask you to wear a mask the next day|0

Day 1 post school closedown an observation big amounts of young people gathering all over the city I guess they didnt get the memo why the schools were cancelled And offtopic but does anyone more politically informed happen to know what if anything will be done regarding people reselling facemasks and other sanitazation products on allegro for as much as 4x 5x the usual price Its disgusting and when I run out of the ones I stocked up on back in decemberjanuary I simply cannot afford to buy new ones with prices like these Same shit I bought for 40pln for 50 masks is now 250pln for 50 Ridiculous|0

This is alas one of those areas where as my old man would have put it Trump can defecate1 in one hand wish in the other and see which fills up firstPart of the reason Phase 1 trials take a month minimum is they arent even testing how effective a drug or vaccine is at this pointtheyre making sure that the vaccine or drug does not have an unforeseen safety issue such as potentially causing a risk of allergic reactions or other reactions to the vaccine itself  Phase 1 studies are NOT something you want to rush as there have been cases where the first hint that a drug is unsafe iswellsomething going wrong in a Phase 1 most infamously with theralizumab aka TGN1412httpsenwikipediaorgwikiTheralizumab but also including fialuridinehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiFialuridine as a potential agent for hepB that wentdisastrously wrong in a Phase 1 trial  Bad things tend to happen when you rush the Phase 1 studyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBIA102474 either in starting the trials too early after animal studies or ramping up the dose to maximum safe level too earlyConsidering that there is already a cottage industry in the US of ambulancechaser attorneys who specialize in vaccine injury cases almost to a one brought in jurisdictions well known for being VERY friendly to suits against pharmaceutical firms and which target the antivaxxer crowdwell the likelihood a pharmaceutical company is going to go ahead and speed up the Phase 1 study because Trump said so is approximately as likely as the New Jersey Devils being bought out by Asmodeus the Grand Duke of Hell Mephistopheles being put in as the Devils general manager and the team being moved to a brand new arena in downtown Dis in the Exact Center of Hades to become the NHLs first interplanar hockey franchise  Which is to say not terribly likely at least as long as you arent dealing with Scandinavian Hell21 Replace of course with the appropriate scatological reference to defecation  Pun of course intended2 What is probably a theological urban legend states that Christian missionaries had some issues at first converting Norsemen due to the idea of Hell being a hot place which didnt seem so bad in the middle of winter|0

Because the people controlling the response have no idea what they are doing There should have been widespread testing 12 months ago and all opportunities to get such done should have been exploredThe US healthcare system will be thoroughly infected in about 10 days due to a lack of testing and PPE Expect US to be one of the more severely affected countries|0
 I am Chinese and I can describe to you my personal experience I live in Sichuan Province As early as January 22 we on social media realized the seriousness of the problem All my friends are discussing how to defend against viruses where to buy masks and how to wear masks correctly  Incorrect wearing is ineffective and call on each other not to go out At the same time I started to advise seniors at home not to go out and to wear masks In those days all young people were worried but the elderly felt it was a false news and did not listen to the young peoples advice But in the following days many people in Wuhan left Wuhan to return to their homes so more and more cases began to be found throughout the country At this time the Chinese government started mobilizing all officials to require all citizens to stay at home Including all older people also knew the seriousness of the matter In fact most people voluntarily quarantine at home because we know how terrible the virus is  However a small number of people are very selfish or ignorant and feel that the virus is not a big deal For these people we all think that coercive measures are necessary because human freedom has boundaries And their ignorance and selfishness endanger public safety We have been isolated for a month and now everything is getting better There are no new cases in my city and people have begun normal lives with masks and disinfection By the way my city has a permanent population of 20 million|0
When I was studying Japanese I used to buy manga from this online book retailer in Japan and got it delivered to Spain Importing it from Japan was much much cheaper than buying them in Spanish in a local bookstore I remember that some Shin Chan tankbon were like 140 yen each which was like one euro at the time It was crazyI used to buy Shin Chan because of the simple vocabulary and the emphasis on daily life I also bought monthly magazines kinda like Shnen Jump but they could get esoteric fast The soul of this ancient warrior remains imprisoned in this ancient scroll yeah nope shopping for groceries with mom for me I didnt have the vocabulary|1

Please avoid offtopic political discussionsOur policy on political posts is as followsThis sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion we therefore wish to limit it The line is inevitably blurred but we use a distinction between policy and politics Policy is fine politics is better posted elsewhere News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy they will be removed Likewise editorialized headlines whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned|1

I worked for Time Warner Cable through the merger with Charter which is now Spectrum  Once Tom Rutledge was in charge it went downhill very fast  He is a horrible greedy and awful person This does not surprise me at all  I was good enough at my job that I was requested by TWC management to stay in my position rather than lose me when I moved back to my home state  Once Charter was involved and found that though I worked in a Spectrum office I was not in North Carolina they laid me off with only a twenty four hour notice  Severance was fine but it was certainly cold hearted for sure and I was treated by HR like I had done something wrongThen after publicly stating they would bring jobs back not send them over seas they took the work I did and sent it over seas  They used a company that was under the TWC umbrella but out sourced its support and sent my former work to that company  Basically they found a loop holeCorporate capitalism running unchecked in this manner is not beneficial to the American people or the companies employees and customers  It only serves a select few and that is the CEO and share holders|1

But you cant determine who is infected immediately so by the time people are diagnosed theyve already been walking around infecting others for a bit and giving them a mask is too little too lateIf everyone wore a mask then infected people would be less able to spread the disease reducing the R0 and so your chances of getting infected would be reduced indirectlyThats why the advice was for everyone to wear masks initially then the mask shortage hit and suddenly masks are useless and thats why we need to conserve them for HCWsIf people were told that the masks are useful but theyre not allowed to use them theyll stockpile them anyway weve seen that behaviour already with other goods If you tell people the masks are useless they wont bother with them and the stockpiles are retained for the HCWs|0

Iodine Dont forget iodineYou can build a mask with paper towels masking tape a bit of wire and rubber bands or yarn string Coat an inner layer of the mask with iodine a few drops to let it soak through and let it dry out  Then build that into the center of your layer sandwich and finish the mask Air that passes through the iodine layer will be reasonably well protected against any virus longterm How much will it pickup  Again 70 effective vs a surgical mask  That means very little It keeps the honest particles honest but wont stop the very small stuff|1
There is obviously a shortage of single use N95 masks An alternative solution would be 3M 600065007500 series halfface masks combined with the 3M P21386038 P3 filters These masks  filters will be better than the single use stuff Granted the price is higher but its still affordable N95  95 efficiency P2  94 efficiency P3  9995 efficiency Shave your neckface for a good seal|1

For me the number of infected in china doesnt warrant the reaction at all which really mind boggles me This is a country of 15 billion in excess And theyre having only around 10k cases of positive infection but theyre doing a massive health initative and spending excessive amounts of money on medical facilities As well as quarantining whole cities and apparently all of the hubei region The numbers dont make sense|1
Ive been following this since midJanuary and I feel the same When I started reading about it it was only in China and there were not yet deaths Its been SO strange and surreal to watch it spread to other countries and then to my country and then to the town a family member lives in and today to my own state I feel like it has arrived and it has knocked on my door|0
They did nothing while they didnt have a clue on how bad it was After seeing the true extend china have done an OK jobWestern countries have had 1 month of extra time to gasp the situation and 10 days of obvious outbreak evidences to take actions Nothing extraordinary have been done The situation in china is chinas responsibility The situation on the west is clearly wests responsibility the west had 1 extra month to work and a lot of information before having cases|1

Then you should exercise you best judgement and follow your local community closely You have a good chance at being prioritized in the event of triage but you will be prioritized more if you arrive early instead of late Part of the triage decision is likelihood of recovery meaning that you want to receive treatment while you have good chances This is according to the Italian Siaarti official guidelines for ICU triageIf the scenario is that there is already triage you may be better off and society possibly as well if you can selfsupply with oxygen That does entail a risk for you but if you are willing to take that risk and so free up a bed then I thank youBefore it comes to that however work from home Only go out for shopping once a week or less if you can Limit your own exposure and others exposure to you Use your disposable income to take days off even if the boss threatens your job No take out food if possible and wear a reusable FFP3 mask if you can Stock up on Isopropyl to clean the reusable mask|1

Not all leadership within the military are trained to be an effective leader and most end up becoming power hungry From E6 and beyond they try to train you to be a chief but people end up getting high off of that power and respect that it givesIf you try to speak up you get shot down immediately regardless if you are right or wrong You dont get paid to think you get paid to be a body for an organization in order for them to report to their leadership that they are manned trained and ready to take on any mission regardless of what reality isIf a captain cant take on a mission it looks bad on his performance review compared to others who will Thus it has to get done no questions asked So many times we been put at risk just to get the mission done rather than waiting a few hours or a day for the conditions to clear up or using the right toolsSo yeah This isnt surprising and honesty I hope we hear more cases like this within the military If there is enough people will take action to fix it If not nothing changes|1

I think the faster doublign is due to aggressive testing I read somewhere that the actual doubling time is more like 6 days whether you are testing for cases or not Obviously theres more cases out there than just the reported ones Im not sure if your math is going to show that cases actually increased that much or if we are just doing a better job of testing for the disease Still lets check back here in a week to see whats up  RemindMe 7 days|1

Yeah I think as this pandemic gets worse even the Republicans might finally want to get rid of Trump and replace him with someone more competent I think there really is a possibility theyll use the 25th amendment if he keeps tweeting more deranged bullshit|0

Ive been wondering if cases of death in young children were being kept quiet or not good to know it seems to simply not be as much of a risk for them  For something like this I worry more about my parents  Thankfully they live in a very quiet part of my province  Im in a small  city but itll show up here eventually  Its probably already here regardless|0

Hey do you have a source showing that its most contagious before symptoms emerge The sources in this article from Healthlinehttpswwwhealthlinecomhealthcoronavirustransmissionspreadwithoutsymptoms indicate that it is possible to transmit during the incubation period but the chances are lower compared to when symptoms beginTo clarify I think its imperative to practice social distancing regardless of whether you think you may be sick or not Just want to be informed as new info emerges about the virus|0
This is why I believe in praisingcondemning behavior and not people for the most partthere are rare examples of people who seem so overwhelmingly goodevil that Im comfortable describing them as suchThere are bad people who do good things and good people who do bad things The world isnt black and white and everyone is capable of change Society would benefit from a radical increase in empathy for everyone Most bad people are just like you and I only difference being that their worst moments happened at the wrong time and place|0

One reason many US public schools hesitate to close for certain scenarios is that many poorer school kids are on free school lunches For some a lot of these free school lunch kids this may be the only  or best  meal they get every day So closing the schools means these kids will go hungry|1

Half the deaths may be from one facility but the reason those deaths were counted  was because one brave scientist went against the CDCs orders They would have chalked up to Pneumonia  Not enough of that going on More like several buildings  White House CDC State Health Departments causing thousands of deaths in about 9 dayshttpstheweekcomspeedreads901405seattlelabuncoveredwashingtonscoronavirusoutbreakonlyafterdefyingfederalregulators|1

Lets assume that the Coronavirus is as contagious as the flu For the record we know that its at least as contagious as the flu which has an R0 of 13 and the actual estimate is an R0 of somewhere between 15 and 4 For the sake of argument though lets assume that its as contagious as the flu and infects the same number of people that the flu doesThis year that number is between 34 and 49 million people Well use 34 million people If 34 million people get Coronavirus with the current mortality rate of 34 1156000 will die and thats just in the US|0

This Triage is always done but its basically a 15 scale of whathow many resources a patient will need and how likely they are to die in the next hour without immediate intervention A patients medicalsocialpersonal history has zero bearing on their medical care outside of very extreme situations  During emergencies war pandemic endemic natural disaster etc we are allowed to stop providing resources to people who have a very poor life expectancy This is what Italy is doing by taking slowly dying patients off of ventilators because new patients need the ventilator more|0

 Grayson urged people to think of 2020 as a really really really really bad flu year adding For most folks this virus is a little bit more dangerous than the typical seasonal flu but not a tonThis is how I see it as well It is just a flu virus  just a powerful oneWhen compared to various doomsday scenarios that people are crafting the sentence it is just a flu is actually among the sanest If we modify the sentence little a bit it is just a strong flu would be spot on|0

Still why would they care about the surface of the asphalt Whos gonna touch that Unless they believe it can be lifted and carried with the wind But this thing is not supposed to be that airborne|1
A mask protects a patient from you N95 and N99 the new unbelieveable N100 is a respirator not a mask and protects the wearer from the patient Respirators must be tight for with no air leaks to be effective Moisture makes them fail and become more porousThese are the reasons and the shortage of masks and respirators for personnel who are actually working with infected people that it is not recommended to wear masks I do think the biggest reason in the USA is the shortage of the equipment Otherwise I think it would be the 1  recommendation|0
Haha right there with you we were born in the right time huh|1
That would be nice but when I spoke to my parents about this imbecile they voted for he has advisors for this stuff He doesnt need to know everything People are working on it for him When I counter that hes removed many qualified advisors in favor of puppets in hopes to keep our numbers down and the economy still looking good due to the upcoming election Im met with silence|1

Scientifically and in most other venues he has not been called that since the 80s Its outdated by a long shotThere is a world of difference between 750 and a few thousand Being in HIV myself Im unaware of validated quadruple digit reporting eitherRegardless HIV does not have super spreaders so this is irrelevant If you have information on behavioral aspects of SARS super spreaders please provide them because this is not a social termThe only behavior shared by SARS super spreaders were things like Living in an apartment building or Sleeping at a hotel Would you call those risky|0

20 of the infected need to be hospitalized Health systems ARE collapsing alreadyImagine needing intensive care but there are no beds nor staff availableYes most people will be mostly fine but there will be a lot of deaths that could have been avoided if not for thisThis is the reason Wuhan has a higher death rate than the surrounding areas because Wuhans health system collapsedIn Italy this is exactly whats happening right nowI am no lunatic I am not hoarding guns or anything really but I try my best in playing my part in not spreading this disease which is what everyone should doIf not for yourself then for the people around you|0
Agreed This makes it look like millions of people are currently effected The news is fear mongering quite a lot and is doing more harm than goodIm so worried for the economic impact of this Its going to hurt far me than the disease will|0
Youre referring to a hypothetical scenario I dont think is realistic  The only people that are going to know they have COVID19 are those that test positive  Those that test positive will be quarantined told to quarantine  No one is going to break quarantine just because Trump said the virus isnt certain death|1
Living in Korea I didnt realize that I didnt own a thermometer until I needed one and none were available lolBut I got one through Amazon and also picked up a blood oxygen meter with a pulseO2 alarm designed to help people with sleep apnea which will put my mind at ease a lot more if I have to try to sleep with pneumonia|1

12 to 18 months is fantasy talk  No way is that going to happen Sooner rather than later the direction is going be to tell atrisk people to stay home and practice social distancing The rest of us  Business as usual Yeah itll spread and itll suck but we may get to herd immunity fairly quickly that way|0
wouldnt a mask prevent you from touching your face as often And if you do wouldnt the mask reduce the risk of the virus getting in your airways|0
Where do people come up with this grand idea oh just go see your MD in the USA if feeling sickI live in NYC NO ONE here is just going to go see their MD or local ER until close to death Thats just reality 1  Does your MD take your insurance can you take off from work Can you even get an appointment that is not weeks or sometimes MONTHS away2  A visit to the ER Deductibles No one can afford that were all living here paycheck to paycheck Get admitted Be prepared to lose everything to those 25000 a day ICU bills Im optimistic but this aint Canada  Its Manhattan Its Social Darwinism at its finest Also believe why we try to take care of the homeless situation here far better than in California  We ALL know that could be us  Just one paycheck away  Anyone of us|1

Thank you for explaining why Whatsap did not work  My mom is 70 and not tech savvy but has traveled to China 4 times and this friend started as her business partner  However the SMS was very redacted and odd I wonder if it was because it was to a different part of the world or not someone with a Chinese number|1

Its not that easy to get tested here either You must fit certain criteria ie have travelled to another country recently or been in contact with a recent case If you are experiencing symptoms there have been some anecdotes on the sydneyaustralian subreddits that it is hard to get tested right now I would assume the majority of the those that have been tested have come from overseas recently|1

Yeah thats the pickle Being active is even more important as you get older but energy levels start dipping with age But the biggest factor Ive noticed at least with myself is plain old work Maybe theres a lot of people that can find the time for physical activity while working a full time job but Ive always found it hard to motivate myself after working a shift When work was slow and I was afforded a lot of time off though I was much more active|1
The cases double every 23 days generally so this either means NY really is growing that fast OR an increase in testing ratecapacity is showing a false spike the disease had already spread in days prior which is a good thing|1

I said this the other day on the post on the italians using 3d printing I am a 3d printing engineer working in a medical company 3d printing is NOT magic It is a tool And like any tool it must be used for the right purpose The main problem with 3d printing adoption in medtech is that it is not consistent and medical device standards require a VERY HIGH level of consistency You and I may have the same 3d file but the final outcome depends on materials the printer the print orientafion and even environmental and weather conditions Medical device standards require that someone making the same product in germany on day 1 gets the same part as someone else making the same part in china on day 467 3d printing is great and flexible yes but then flexibility comes at a cost of consistency In an emergency I would say yes by all means use it but the user needs to be knowing what they are doing and the approproate risk assesments done|1
Ok|1
A bad conclusion If you dont test you wont get cases ultimately making the virus spread more The population there is in the millions and only 32 have been tested in other words not enough|0
Thats the sad thing so many younger people 40 yo or younger are getting unemployed yet the coronavirus itself would affect them the least|0
In America the right uses it and communism as a slur for anything left of laissezfaire capitalism So for Americans we have to relabel basic social policies socialism to convince the uneducated voters who buy into that slur that socialism isnt a bad word its economic policy aimed at helping them|1

I mean everyone gets sick when the flu goes around tooThis is just like the flu Except everyone is getting it simultaneously and its flooding the Healthcare system causing intensive care to struggle to treat those who are elderly or with preexisting issuesThe fear mongering in the media is just to try and get people to slow down the spread which is important to limit deaths due to simply not being enough beds in the hospitalThat being said Im tired of people making it out to be a damn zombie apocalypse and doing drastic things They dont understand what the mission is here|0
exactly not fear mongering to state the obvious|1

I dont know exactly what governments are doingThere are very few governments that dont appear to be practicing censorship around this Very odd to say the least Ive never seen something like this that seems so coordinated across so many governments when it seems that they are intentionally putting their citizens at risk We are 18 months away from a potential vaccine I doubt there will be a vaccine for this Look what happened when they tried to make a vaccine for SARS or many other viruses They will however continue to say one is coming as its part of how they are keeping people from caring about this|0

reformation of retirementcare maybe  BTW I feel just like my pal above  they just cant shutdown the entire country because of how fragile our economy is and maybe because they dont even have the means to do it so the ones who are gonna die of it are just casualties But like everything theyre doing theyre thinking very very shortterm I wonder whats worse  a very tight and short shutdown and early quarantine  I mean the media were so sensationalist about what happened in China that they had their time to get everyone scared enough  or a long term fight against an epidemic  Italy is now on lock down but what if they took those measures to prevent rather than to contain  I just dont know but Im very well inclined to think that they really dont care about the deaths they just need to keep things going|0

I find it quite amazing that you come to that conclusion based on some numbers However you are aware there is quite a difference if somebody is 66 or 86 right   Italy has more old older people  wise of their population then Germany Italy for example has 15 million males above 80 years while Germany has 1 million   There is prob more going on then just old age but to dismiss it based on the  of people above 65 seems quite ignorant because there tend to be quite a difference between a 65 and a 85 year old|0

Hey at least Im not gonna die from this I guess I do want to get tested before moving back to my parentsThanks for the condolence though|1
Okay problem here is FranzWerner Haas is not the CEO of CureVac So you might reconsider that statement And no there is not just the Welt am Sonntag report there is confirmation by the main investor in this company by the Health Ministry of Germany and they all collaborate the story What do you actually want Trump to admit it You know the accused rarely admit that they were wrong There is plenty of evidence You just need to want to see it|0
Im no fan of Trump but I almost wonder that if Obama was doing this the media and reddit would be praising him for his bravery|1

Im a care giver My job absolutely has to be done everyday I cant miss days like that or the people I care for go un cared for They require 24 hour awake staff There are so many communities like the one I work at Im super scared about getting it I hope that if I get quarantined someone else who works there can take extra shifts Pretty much I feel I will most definitely get it eventually and I may not recover due to having type 1 diabetes HOWEVER I will work my shifts until I cant any more Also I dont want the government to take me somewhere to die alone Thats my biggest fear|1
I thought seriously that is what social services are for I dont know the answers either but it seems that no matter how much money we throw at issues it doesnt solve themwhy cant we solve them|0
Yes thank you for saying this|1
I dont have time to argue about this but this is still incorrect For any given patient the time between being a suspected case and getting a test result has never been 12 days either on average or as a reasonable upper limit Most suspected cases have never and never will be tested The most serious cases may be tested and have a result quite quickly So theres no interpretation under which the up to 12 days observation is reasonable useful or interesting and you cant use it sensibly in any model or forecast|0

Well I mean theres only so many times they can report the numbers and advise caution before people get bored In fact the more you report on it the less people care and the more you get desensitized to it I know I am The thing that really sucks is that China started to consider the cases differently theyre only counting certain types of cases etc so even if they WERE reporting the numbers theyd be woefully low So until we see a big change I dont really blame them for not reporting it|0
So far it seems to be worse in almost all cases Then again we probably wouldnt know about asymptomatic cases|0

Like I said its far too early for a real study there arent any completed studies for any proposed treatments yet Butit has been declared a breakthrough by their panel of the expertsthe media reported that of 130 people that used it everyones symptoms either improved or at least stopped worseningthe discoverer of SARS says people on it test negative after 4 daysI get that you want a formal study so do I But the logic of somebody could have completed a study by now cuts both ways if thats true where is the completed study showing it doesnt work and why are they taking so long|1

1 minute agoEveryone with a cold should be suspected every Chinese even not from a Wuhan with a cold in other countries will be quarantined and tested multiple times Isnt it true But yet there are 6k suspected in a region of over 20 milion its really nonsensical considering that statistically 10 of the population will have some kind of cold in the winter at any one time We are seeing the very tip of the iceberg if we are talkin about just pneumonia maybe 1020 of cases will get pneumonia most will not get diagnosed anyway plus people are hiding there are reports of 500 dollar bounties if you report people with a fever do you understand the situation|0
thank you very much really appreciated|1

Trump has shown he will fire or worse prosecute anyone who dares to go against him  Now he is saying the Coronavirus is not a serious threat he said the severity of this virus is a hoax by Democrats to make him look bad its always about himIn that kind of environment do you want to be a government official that informs the public things are getting bad simply by stating the factsReporter  Mr President a government official in Florida has released numbers showing a huge spike in Coronavirus cases in that state  Doesnt this show the virus is reaching pandemic levelsTrump  The official is an Obama lover I dont even think he was authorized to release that information and leaking sensitive information is really criminal  We need to look into this Im going to ask my attorney Barr to see if a crime has been committed there  And we need to get rid of these lying Democrats in government|0
We will be ready Hopefully lockdown is coming soon Geez its weird to think about that let alone actually want one|1

Every employee has about 30 daysyear of paid time off This is already factored in the wages At least 15 weeks MUST be used each year Unused time is accrued for the following year and then paid as wages if still unusedIf sick you get a doctors certificate and you are exempt from work The state pays the wages for sick days Both your employer and the state can send a doctor to perform surprise checks on you to prevent abuse|0

I was thinking EI because its already got the infrastructure and ramping it up to include a CoViD19 program should be cheaper and simpler than building something from the ground up Hiring more people and expanding an existing program will be cheaper than having our healthcare system collapse and economy implode imo but you are right too Its government sigh Things that SHOULD happen a certain way dont always Working in the Public Service the Phoenix pay system is an example of when things go wrong it gets even more complicated|0

Honestly I think its more likely that ECCC is hoping that someone else will take the fall for shutting them down so they dont have to appear responsible for the guaranteed clusterfuckBefore I say this I want to make it clear I think they should have cancelled the event a week ago and Im strongly hoping it does actually end up getting cancelledI think the biggest reason theyve avoided cancelling the event so far is because so many artists rely on big conferences like ECCC as their primary source of income Not only are booths expensive but this is also the sort of event where artists will have staked a lot of money making sure theyve got things to sell and an attractive booth to sell it from That adds up and not being able to recoup those investments could very easily put a bunch of people out of businessHeres what Im hoping will happen a bunch of major vendors most importantly DC and Dark Horse have pulled out of the event and ECCC is officially offering refunds to conferencegoers whove changed their minds about attending If both vendors and customers keep pulling out en masse its a LOT easier to make a case for cancelling the event entirelyOf course it would be best if they were to cancel the event sooner rather than later so people can cancel their travel arrangements before its too late to get refunds but nobody wants to bite the bullet and take the responsibility for the clusterfuck thats inevitably going to ensue|1

The flaw with your analysis is mentioning places you leave and spend only some hours or minutes in trains elevators or even schools and cruise ships where you spend long hours I mean Im not sure what you want to probe as cruise ships being viral nightmares are a well researched topic for both gastric and respiratory bugs with tons of papers pre 2020 so pre coronavirus The coronavirus quarantine just added the general public knowledge on how they are with the reactions of those who dont know such ships on say Twitter to those reporting from the quarantine being of pure shock as how insanely small the inner windowless cabins are with the main reaction being not even virus related but rather the Id go mad in there So I see no relevance of your math comparing buses in which you spend say 30 minutes per day on average commute to cruise ships as you spend say 10h per day in the camped cabins normally Not during quarantine and time matters Also air circulation matters and buses well open doors every stop So do elevators every requested floor Inner cruise ship cabins are locked apart form ship air circulation for half of any 24h So all you proved is math used as in just numbers with no relations to time place and air flow means nothingEdit also if you want pure math the typical family 4 person inner cabin shown on many quarantine bloggers posts among them a very popular family is actually SMALLER than jail cells per square meter per capita compared to most Western countries among them the US Canada and all European Union ones Per your calculations And per Twitter and Instagram images from said accounts So yeah Nit extreme at all Also most Western jails have barred and small but still windows|0
the real percentage is lower but that doesnt save the healthcare systemlets say we think we have 1000 patients and 200 go into the hospital  20 percent  lets say we actually have 2000 patients and 200 still need to go into the hospital yay 10 percent wait my hospital is still fucked|0

Yes I do Check my history Ive been reading up on it since January Some are late to the party because its now in front of them Dont know if thats you There is of course a chance they might have it but the point I was making is that lets say they started showing symptoms 2 weeks ago during that time it would have either acted like a normal virus because their immune system is managing it well therefore functioning okay despite being a little ill or it would have got progressively worse where they would have needed hospitalisation by now and not in a position to be scrolling reddit 111 is no doubt overwhelmed with very people needing serious help In this particular posters circumstances especially when its been requested not to call unless you need serious help should they be calling Or is it now a free for all very much like its seems to have become in this group now since the large increase in members number|1

To expandThe most likely number at this moment post incubation phase is enough to generate a handful of hospitalisations so 100300 But this lags infection by two weeks on average so the number of infections is exponentially higher as epidemics grow exponentially The thousands who are infected are mostly people infected in the last fortnight who havent yet begun to feel sick This will be true as the epidemic grows just substituting thousands for some larger number Until this peaks most infections at any given moment are recent presymptom incubating infectionsThey will show up at hospital in two weeks|0

I am so sick of hearing this shit The numbers published by China have been consistent with the spread in every other country The difference is that they did something about it when they had 500 cases because they saw the writing on the wall Decision makers in China either understand basic high school math or listen when it is explained to them Same thing happened in south Korea What you and everyone else who denied the information from China is experiencing is called normalcy bias You arent understanding or accepting that this virus is different from the ones weve seen in living memory The math doesnt lie Every day that you try to blame China for this disease or pretend its not a big deal or ignore basic math is a day that will have hundreds dead in two weeks When China had a quarter of the cases the US has now they enacted the largest quarantine in history and mobilized one of the most industrialized nations in the world to provide medical supplies and PPE China took draconian measures and told the rest of the world that this was going to be bad months ago Stop trying to blame China and ask your elected officials why no one at the federal level is doing anything|0

This is all true but the biggest advantage they have is that you can drive across the whole country in 45 minutes You can have a larger central lab running all tests for the whole country with samples being delivered within 30 minute of being taken Contrast that to Indonesias xthousand islands or Delhis traffic or even Iowa or Perth|1

Here is a thought experiment Do everything you can avoid getting infected There is NO reason why you would want to get infected If you DO NOT get infected there is ZERO chance of you spreading it to others There is also the chance of getting infected again if you recover Wash your hands eat properly stay healthy and if you do get sick stay home Yes this is a scary situation But if you start with the mindset that you CAN avoid this then maybe you will Be smart and think positive|0

Look have you ever played plague inc Theres always a news headline about them thinking about cancelling the Olympics in Rio due to the new disease And every time Ive played they go on with the Olympics And every time immediately after the Olympics the amount of infected people goes through the roof and Rio becomes infected We shouldnt have large gatherings during a pandemic thats just idiotic You know what a virus does when it gets in a space with a large crowd of people It infects as many as it can Music festivals should be cancelled as well as many other large gatherings yknow unless we wanna all be infected |0

I agree  I just had a relative tell me they are going on a cruise within the next month and how much they are looking forward to it  Not even one thought or concern on their part of what is going on and they live in a highly populated area  I found there is no reasoning with people when they are in denial and selfish  It makes me mad because if you dont care enough to protect yourself and your household at least try to care enough to realize you could potentially spread something to other people who are smart enough not to hop on a cruise while theres a freaking pandemic going on|0
I think thats why they are staying open Because they dont want the bad publicity when they dont give paid leave Especially when all these hero companies are doing just that My mom said they cut peoples hours if they dont have enough sales because they are a charity Theres another issue with them not closing The outlets Those places are impossible to sanitize because everything is thrown into the bins The people who go there would rather die than miss a day Some of them are there from open to close every single day And they get very close to each other|1

Of course the medical workers should have a high priority on masks Maybe the resources of masks will become richer in the future|1
The author calls it a preventable complication you claimed that no one is saying it is preventable Well the very article I quoted does say that multiple timesThere are other papers talking about how to protect against the injury by adjusting the ventilator settings which apparently is not standard practice everywhere or it wouldnt get published as a new thing It took many years to realise that the price of normalising physiological parameters was often unacceptably high and to put the problem of VILI central to our clinical approach 7httpserrersjournalscomcontent24135132|0

I have no ideological axe to grind I speak Chinese have lived in China for years and I am there nowBelieve it or not some of this is actually first hand experience including communications with a personal contact a doctor present in a hospital in Wuhan on Jan 19 That is what flicked a switch in my mind removing any and all doubt the severity of the situation was underreported by an order of magnitude this person reported a hospital over loaded on the verge of collapse with over 10 dead from the virus many patients doing poorlyYou might want to open your mind to the potential at least the claims I made are true The stuff I said isnt considered controversial even in China People are outraged these doctors had to sign admissions of criminality And it is in the public record that no WHO officials have been granted access to Wuhan as of yet Show me one article that says otherwiseSomehow you have managed to insulate yourself from these well established truths to what ultimate purpose I can only speculate|0
I work in a clinic If it spreads here and we dont take isolation seriously then Im far more likely than average to get infected and my immune suppressed family members are much more likely to die from itBy your logic and your own argument for continuing to expose others for the sake of personal economics you must personally want me to get sick and for my family to diePetty bickering aside I dont expect well ever get a 3week stayhome order nor do I expect people like you would follow it if we did I just wish people would be more mindful and careful to avoid spreading viral illnesses whether common cold flu or COVID2019  But most people really dont care once theyre sick they figure its too late for them so who cares about everyone else and often say things like the chronically ill or elderly are dying anyway  Dont be like that Thats all I really mean to say|0

My GP said not to go to the surgery because she couldnt be sure I didnt have it 111 didnt want to know But guess what most will recover at home and wont be added to the stats If it so happens that you are up shit creek youd ring an ambulance and end up being tested if admitted Its just another good way of keeping figures falsely low as far as Im concerned I just hope one day they do retrospective antibody  testing although I wont hold my breath|0

Once you have the infection it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs said Philip Tierno Jr Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at NYU School of MedicineSo it may not be reinfection but rather the virus was still presentShe first tested positive in late January and was discharged from hospital after recovering on Feb 1 according to the statementIf some similar cases result in death doesnt this suggest that the fatality rate is underestimated To have recovered on Feb 1 is such a long time ago considering the length of the outbreak|0

You cant compare antivirals as a category theyre quite specific to the family of virus they target  Anti virals work extremely well for HIV that infection used to be a death sentence it no longer impacts life expectancyBut HIV was the focus of huge amounts of research  The odds that an existing drug targets a new virus are not very good  It may have some shared biochemistry with another pathogen but maybe not|0
Using TOR browser As coronavirus spreads across the US Chicago penguins got the opportunity to see sights perhaps never before seen in the species history  Because the citys Shedd Aquarium was closed down to prevent transmission of the virus the buildings penguins were allowed to roam free and explore other exhibits discovering a whole new world just outside their enclosure  Without guests in the building caretakers are getting creative in how they provide enrichment to animals the aquarium told the Chicago Tribune introducing new experiences activities foods and more to keep them active encourage them to explore problemsolve and express natural behaviors Videos shared by the Shedd showed the flightless birds learning about their neighbors for the first timeLinked tweets with videoshttpstwittercomsheddaquariumstatus1239248971006185478  httpstwittercomsheddaquariumstatus1239661883063492611  httpstwittercomsheddaquariumstatus1239662268859719681 At least the penguins will come out of this crisis smarter and more powerful than ever|1

Look up the hearings from today and yesterday where our health officials had to testify on the handling of coronavirus thus far    Also I heard that the WHO offered the US tests that they had made weeks ago but instead we had the CDC start making our own The rushed response caused tests to go out faulty as well as shortages We have been relying on China for manufacturing and since they are on lockdown were running out of supplies to keep making our own tests    Nobody knows why we refused the tests from WHO|0
Just did as an edit to the original comment Only for the bit interviewing me though For the rest of the report which is the lady from PHE I think the easiest tldr is We really need more information before were happy to say were 100 sure about anything but please trust us to be doing the best that can be done See my comments on the OP above Noone except The Onion nb including me wants to say Dont worry it only kills old people but because of that everyone is equally not saying Dont worry too much if youre under 60 because it only kills older people but at the same time be careful you dont infect those older people with the mild symptoms you may be sneezing about and try to help them if and when they may need to stay indoors|1
South Korea actually tests people With a population of 51 million theyre testing 10000 people per day If the US was as serious about testing theyd be doing 60000 tests per day Instead they tested 77 people yesterday 77South Korea tests any one whos had contact with a patient and anyone diagnosed with pneumonia If your doctor thinks you need the test you get one for free immediately and if you just want one because you feel like you have a bug or something they charge you 160 refunded if your test is positiveIf you test positive the local health department immediately begins tracking down everyone youve had contact with and testing them and having them selfquarantine until the results are back 5 hours  3 daysBy immediate testing they reduce the spread because people know theyre infected and stop going out exposing other people They also reduce the bad cases because they can immediately begin treating the moderate cases before they become more seriousBy slowing down the spread they reduce the strain on hospitals making a bottleneck less likely and the thus preventing the cascade of deaths like China and Italy have seenFor an extra bonus the government is covering all the costs of treatment and paying quarantined people 450 per week per person in their family So no hassle from insurance companies or hospitals and you wont go bankrupt from medical bills|1

Whats my conspiracy theory That using masksrespirators properly requires a little visual instruction and habituating practice Not a nursing degree paired with direct access to a certified biohazard disposal system That people can get enough oxygen through them to live while wearing them all day That this issue is solely about inhuman capitalistic supply management and the lack of integrity that would have enabled the CDC to just tell us that medical staff take priority and the rest of us should take one for the team and not purchase anyUnderpaid overworked laborers wear these things for hours at a time sweating in hot humid outdoor conditions Everyone should have them stockpiled everyone should be trained and practiced in their use regularly throughout standard education They dont need to be 6 a pop to be commercially viable and they should be subsidized beyond that The gall and gull of those who suggest that this was somehow unavoidable or is an understandable mistake is astounding|0
You mentioned 911 Coincidentally 911 happened the year I turned 18 I didnt think it was much of a comingofage eitherI worried about religious freedom about the rights of Muslims in America about the possibility of war and the effects of terrorism And a lot of what I worried about happenedBut life went on I went to college I learned new things I made friends I defined more carefully what I believed and what was important to me I learned that the government wasnt perfect that my country wasnt the best in the world that in fact there is no such thing as a best country I found ideas and people worth fighting forAnd I also learned that when hard times come around people help each other When things are unfamiliar frightening and sad people come out on their porchesvirtual porches naturally in times of epidemicand support each other They say How are you holding up and Can I do anything to help and Take care of yourselfAt first things are new and frightening and we feel like the world is going to end But humans can get used to anything and this virus is something we can get used to All that handwashing and videoconferencing is going to become second nature part of the routine Sometimes it will be hectic and sometimes sad and sometimes it will be funny or encouraging because people by their nature will find humor and support no matter what their circumstancesDo not underestimate human resilience|0

Because people in general are very bad at not touching their face A study found for example that medical students people who should already know not to be touching their faces touched their face 23 times per hourhttpswwwajicjournalorgarticleS0196655314012814abstract The average person does so even more when theres any irritation such as wearing a mask 44 of face touching included contact with a mucous membrane that was susceptible to infection and 27 of that 27 times per hour was contact with the eyes which is a vulnerable point of infection Its why masks alone are of minimal benefit but saw notable benefits when also combined with regular handwashing or other controlsThe primary benefit to wearing a mask is that if you are sick you are not spraying out as much of the virus on your surroundings when you coughsneezebreathe That significantly reduces how much other people are going to get infected Wearing a mask yourself does protect your mouth and nose if worn correctly and thus does provide protection especially for those who are in sustained close contact with people who are infected but you still need to keep your hands clean avoid touching your eyes keep the mask properly affixed dispose your mask after each use and seriously please stop touching your face in generalThe reason its still a good idea for people to wear masks in general especially in highdensity areas is that if you are wearing a mask and you catch COVID19 it will significantly reduce your chances of spreading it to anyone else before you show symptoms It works by having everyone protect those around them its a team effort|0

An epidemiologist should not be spreading blatantly false information like this The Chochrane review cited here clearly includes studies that support the effectiveness of face mask useFor example here is one randomized control study mentioned in the reviewILI  influenzelike illnesshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed20088690httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed20088690Mask use hand hygiene and seasonal influenzalike illness among young adults a randomized intervention trialMETHODS A randomized intervention trial involving 1437 young adults living in university residence halls during the 20062007 influenza season was designed     RESULTS We observed significant reductions in ILI during weeks 46 in the mask and hand hygiene group compared with the control group ranging from 35 confidence interval CI 953 to 51 CI 1373 after adjusting for vaccination and other covariates Note that the masks were distributed to all participants in the relevant group in this study before ILIs began to spreadFor casecontrol studies the review itself states the following about mask useThese data suggest that wearing a surgical mask or a N95 mask is the measure with the most consistent and comprehensive supportive evidence Seven out of eight studies included masks as a measure in their study and six out of seven of these studies found masks to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis Handwashing was also included in seven of the studies with four studies showing handwashing to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis All other measures were shown to be statistically significant in multivariable analysis on only one or two occasions In the reviewers own words againThe pooled casecontrol studies which focused on the SARS coronavirus SARS CoV suggest that implementing barriers to transmission isolation and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain respiratory virus epidemics We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of devices such as the N95 respirator over simple surgical masks This evidence is supported by a high quality hospitalbased trial Loeb 2009 which reports noninferiority between face barriers Overall masks were the best performing intervention across populations settings and threats More expensive and uncomfortable especially if worn for long periods than simple surgical masks N95 respirators may be useful in very highrisk situations but additional studies are required to define these situations When supposed experts are ignoring evidence like this and passing out bad advice it can sow confusion and undermine the publics trust in all expert advice You should retract your false statement immediately to prevent any harm from befalling those that would trust your status as a verified epidemiologist|1
Right so in what capacity would closing the Disney parks be of any value if we continue to allow other mass gatherings across the USA We need to shut it all mass gatherings for over a month for this to work Thats what China did At just over 900 cases they quarantined over 50 million people The USA is at or already beyond that threshold What good would closing down Disney be except PR if you allow malls movies concerts sports political rallies conferences competitions amusement parks waterparks arcades schools universities churches  other places of worship museums tourist hotspots casinos etc to remain open|1

i think the data is lagging because people cant get the test not because people arent becoming symptomatic  from the anectdotes ive been seeing this confirmed case number is only a fraction of people in the hospitals which is bound to be only a fraction of people that are symptomatic but not severe which is certainly a small fraction of people that have it but are not symptomatic yet  too uncertain to do the math based on that but were probably in the hundreds of thousands if not millions at this point and rising|1

same thing about the great and free healthcare system of germany You cant read an article or talk to a German about healthcare without Germany has the best healthcare system in the world being thrown around The propaganda is everywhere But in my experience you cant access fast good healthcare on the public system and if you pay out of pocket the costs are many times what it would be under free market conditions thats because I found the same treatment for a fraction of the cost Im young and have no major illnesses so for me the public health services might as well not exist and if I dont make a high enough income its literally ILLEGAL for me to be on private insurance even though my premiums would be low I would have better service and I would PAY for it Great if you have cancer in Germany so Ive heard Or a major operation so Ive heard But anything I want done either isnt covered or is covered but you have to wait MONTHS For TERRIBLE service at thatAnd of course you can look at any case total and tell me how Germany is handling the Coronavirus Its like pulling teeth to get Germans both the PUBLIC and the OFFICIALS to admit it even is a problem Best in the world indeedIf its so great then how come SG and HK has the virus pretty much contained and we dont My state went from 1 case to 14 in what two days Last Friday NRW has 20 cases Now look at it|1

Was that the CNN article If you had read the entire article you shouldve also read this Many will be working from their homes however with strict quarantine guidelines in place in many cities and most businesses urging people to work remotely if possible to reduce the chances of transmissionTo be fair the title of that article was really misleading and made me scratch my head at the strange dichotomy of on one hand closing all public places but going back to work on the other  Its still many under strict quarantine and as for the rest well China is a very large country|1

In our area its been the same but the focus has been on influenza and an accompanying stomach virus that seems to be floating in rotation with itOur local schools have been shut down twice this season once before Christmas once after in January and they are considering closing down again due to the sheer number of absences Rural area  after those state tax dollars to function so they really start panicking too latewhen kids start missing school vs when it starts initially spreading  they have classrooms of kids coughing up lungs I expect your area is probably going through similar issues w the flu and COVID seems like a far of improbability to them |0

My surmise is that the CDC told Trump that social distancing can dramatically slow the spread which is apparently true we saw it in China and in a very dim witted way Trump interpreted it to mean it can get better or worse I think he clearly doesnt understand the threat and didnt wrap his mind around how exponential growth works or the implications I also believe the CDC may be underestimating the risk that the things we can do to slow spread close schools movie theaters sporting events may not be enough and it may have been what the Chinese did that we cant do that made the difference top down social control of movement mass lockdowns huge internal mobilization of people to quickly respond to flash points We have yet to see whether a western democracy like Itay or South Korea can cope with this do it doesnt spread like wildfire through the whole society Also if it does spread like wildfire I think it will be a human tragedy unknown in living memory Tens of thousands dying at home or in huge temporary facilities because they cant receive adequate supportive care He was shocked to hear 60000 Americans die in a bad flu season Imagine how shocked hell be to hear 5 million Americans could die from this He better pray remdesivir lowers morbidity and mortality by 80 or things could get worse then anything weve ever seen|0

The problem there is interstate travel Take NY and Florida Ny could be containing existing cases but it will keep getting new ones from FL There are flights back and forth constantly with many with residence in both states Florida is ignoring the virus for now because they dont want to lose the tourist dollars and snowbird money When it gets bad all the part time residents will head home and start up new pockets of infection Canada also has a bunch of part time residents here and in AZ Then you have the seasonal international workers like Trump employs who will be sent home to spread it there I live in FL and anyone with half a brain knows its going to be a shit show We dont have the infrastructure to deal with it|0

Youre completely ignoring taxes Which is understandable even most Americans dont subtract taxes from their income and only budget based on gross income My spouse is in a labor union so their taxes and other things are higher than others but I have to subtract about 25 from their income when I do the budget So while on paper and when filing taxes they make 6 figures but its actually 5 figures net We pay over 1000 a month in taxes so subtract that from your budget figures|0

Thank you for pointing this out I grew up in a small town where a large portion of the population worked in furniture manufacturing Henredon to be precise When they closed the factory there was literally no other industry or jobs for these people Hundreds unemployed with no real options for employmentHeres the thing Henredon furniture is and always was expensive AF The prices for their solid wood furniture didnt get any cheaper when they closed the plants and outsourced the labor but the companys labor costs did The people who could always afford to buy it were STILL able to afford it Corporate asshats were making even more money for themselves and stockholders Meanwhile the hundreds of families that relied on a simple manufacturing job to support themselves were devastatedand now they have no option but to buy the much cheaper made outside the USA crap|0

no literature just common sense seeing as WHOCDCNHS all list pneumonia as a common symptom for severe cases but not for mild they also only started including mild pneumonia in the mild category last month this suggests that it isnt common but they didnt want to lump those with pneumonia under severe if its mild pneumoniathere is no reason to think that having pneumonia is a likely outcome for mild cases|0

My guess is that the virus is already circulating in the general population in the US but the reluctance to test means we dont know it yet  Its just a cold in most people for the few percent of people that get it worse its like a flu  For the very small percentage of people that get it really bad its possible to need hospitalization and thats where we hear about cases like the one in California|0

EDIT 2 So I wrote this after having consumed quite the bit of alcohol my inebriated mind thought testing was to be stopped in all of Washington which is not the case Evergreen health isnt stopping all testing either so yes a bit of an over reaction from my part Felt should clarify I do believe the numbers are helpful though I can see how if the virus has spread to a large percent of people in an area it would be deemed pointless to continue testing thereHowever it would be nice if regardless of a location having an endemic or not for testing to still continueunless low on test kits and need them elsewhere where testing would be more justifiable Cause yes I like my numbers It would be beneficial in the future to see just how contagiousdeadly this was though I know the numbers wont be 100 exact I just like accurate dataand since at the time I thought it was state wide I figured I would like to see when people in places that would affect my mother start testing positive so I can then consider the best options for her Just assume its already there I know I knowEDIT Over reacted a bit its not in ALL of WA just a specific area Still the fact that they can do thisI stand by my rant for the most part The state has not reached 100 confirmed cases and already stopping testing even if in one locationWhat the fuck is the CDC fucking thinking I am in Washington and am pissed right now How is stopping testing helpful in any fucking way How does that even make any sense I am an hour and a half away from Seattle there are no confirmed cases of the virus in my county however there probably are people with it here already but I would like to know and keep updated I am a pretty levelheaded person I have not panicked nor am I acknowledge the virus and have taken what precautions I can But fuck man  I have a mother with serious underlying health issues my concern is for her not for me If she gets it she is as good as dead by a miracle would she survive and if she does with what side effects That might sound fucked but its the conclusion Ive come to given what I know so far about the virus Or maybe the virus is nothing to worry about and itll all be a ofuckingkIf cases would start popping up in my county in the center she goes to get treatment 3 times a week to the hospital she has to go visit for a surgery next month in my work place risk of bringing it homeit would be nice to fucking knowIf the claims of China underreporting their numbers are true is this not another form of thatGod fucking damn it CDC Or America IDK just fuckOk  Im done Im just in slight disbelief and needed to rant I hope somehow this isnt true or a miscommunication as I cant find anything on the CDC or WA state dept of health website about this or they decide to start testing back again|1

This wont be an answer because I dont know about the French situation Instead Ill just highlight some complexities of testing and why this complexity means the numbers wont be comparable everywhere First 300 is a low number It might just suggest something about the network of casesfor example outbreak among students etc The virus can be expected to discriminate less as it spreads In addition cases is not the same as infected Cases are the ones tested for a virus with a positive result while infected are the ones who have been exposed to the virus and consequently infected without necessarily being tested In Italy as the epidemic exploded they stopped testing suspected people and mainly focused on people who were very sick or otherwise strategically necessary to test This might skew cases towards older people because older people are more likely to get very sick|0

Its not enough To find one student with it means that many are already infected Kids are at home hopefully but probably not isolated Now theyll give it to their parents who are still working and it will end up at multiple workplacesRemember that the outbreak worldwide came from one single case less than 3 months ago Every person who is not fully quarantined has the potential to lead to the same number of cases in 3 months More actually because China managed to atop the exponential growth The west has not and so far Im not convinced they will|1

People need to realise one huge thing about China It was not a modern country prior to the takeover It was even less a modern country compared to Russia Theres a reason why communist totalitarian regime held much stronger in certain nations than others For the average Chinese national life has indeed improved and the regime has such a powerful control of the narrative that even if it didnt the majority of the populace would never know|1

I can see the reason some people want to call it WuhanChinese virus I as someone from Wuhan also called it Wuhan virus at the very beginning but hearing Trump using it public on Twitter in such racial relationship in US atm still scares people there is already hate crime popping up related to the virus and whats stopping people getting attacked for wearing mask while looking Asian|0

I think its to comfort people who are scared While my mental health issues have gotten easier to manage when I was younger I was a huge hypochondriac Something like this would have made my anxiety awful Being reassured that the virus was less of a risk to me because Im young and not immunocompromised would have been a huge relief That said I do see how it can come off as offensive especially depending on how you say it Everyone should take precautions to stay healthy and avoid spreading disease Even if youre young and healthy someone else who you spread an illness to may not be and of course every death is tragic|0

I may have missed this but how do you see this spreading through the rest of the world I am not saying a mass epidemic like wuhan but cases will still rise|1
Thats absurd You need to make assumptions to act quickly in this situation when you know China is giving the wrong numbersWhen the disease starts spreading like wildfire and clearly has an R0  3 in countries like South Korea its more than past the time to say that 75000 in China is a RIDICULOUS numberIts also quite funny how you ignored the part of my statement that said their reaction in shutting down their economy and citiesIts fine man bury your head in the sand and pretend its ok until it shows up at your doorstep Theres plenty of respected medical journals that have said the number was much higher much earlier in this process but if you need to tell yourself these blatant lies to cope then so be itx200BIts not my life fortunatelyIts just a bit hard to believe theres people like you that are this deluded|1
This happened in january You are being way over critical of this person and their behavior Its not fair to expect this person had enough understanding of what at the time was an isolated emergency in on province in china to follow all the possible precautions to stop the spread of what they though was a bad cold If they had done this 2 weeks ago then your criticisms would be valid|0
Seriously a few govt official in a province fucked up and suddenly its all China bad Most western country did nothing while china locked down except gloated Our own gov denied it was an issue until less than a week ago That would of been 70 days since China notified WHO and 50 days after China locked down  Why dont this guy lead a team to find everyone with cold like symptoms that have covid19 in the US if it was that easy|0

He also goes on to share during the question period that he doesnt think there is a significant iceberg of mild cases that we arent seeing in China because some community testing hasnt really shown that This is alarming to me and something I was really hoping forTo clarify why this is alarming is because a lot of undetected mild cases would lower the CFR  A lot of people were thinking this was the case and real CFR would be around 1 instead of the 35 we are seeing everwhere  which might just be the real CFR|1

While anything is possible its far more likely than not that the virus leaves you with protective immunity Coronaviruses are well known and studied They generate strong adaptive immune responses which clear the virus and leave the host with both antibodymediated immunity lasts 6 months and cytotoxic T cell memory which lasts yearsImportantly while viruses do mutate They cant mutate their external proteins very much as they need to bind to our cellular receptors to get into our cellsSo while the various Coronavirus strains require the body to regenerate an adaptive response they wont fundamentally change our bodies ability to do itHelpfully there is also usually some crossreactivity between strains of a given virus against proteins that the virus hasnt mutated or hasnt mutated much|1

For those who dont know while the secretary of the Navy was on vacation and Teddy Roosevelt was acting Secretary during that time he declared war on Spain and then immediately resigned his post as Assistant Secretary so he could personally form a band of fighters the rough riders and fight in it himself To the end of his life he was proud that his unit took the most dangerous jobs and had the highest causality rate and yeah he also shot a few dudes Teddys war also resulted in Spain losing nearly all its overseas territories|0

For sure Medical o2 is normally given out at 4 bar If you control pressure at 15 bar or a set pressure then a lot of the derived functions of flow and time can be adjusted and calculated manually Pneumatic logic could be used to regulate the flow but are more prone to failure over time 15 bar pressure controlling 12 breaths a minute is 17280 times a day for 2 weeks Then alarms need to be in place to notify healthcare workers of failure So electromechanical solenoid valves are pretty key I cant think of a suitable replacement for such high usage|0

I would add that we dont really know how many people currently infected in China  Estimates range from 50K to almost a millionThis implies very different strategies   If the number is truly close to a million then containment may be impossible and more focus should be placed on fasttracking concurrent vaccine trials because were almost certainly looking at an endemic virus with major yearly outbreaks|1

People love horrible news they thrive on it and make it sound like we are going to all die It happened during Swine flu and somewhat during SARS Every bit of somewhat good news is shot down by a lot of people saying they are lying but when bad news comes out that 600000000 people will catch this they go off like experts This is a very contagious virus that is horrible for old people and people need to do their part and be mindful of their actions over the coming months but jesus fucking christ stop spreading constant negative BSPS Leave the toilet paper on the shelves|0

 why cant landlords also lose some moneyBecause it is a fundamentally different situation  Restaurants are losing money because no one or not enough people to cover costs are eating there  It is not the case that people are eating and then not having to pay  For rent the landlords still have to provide living accommodations  While some things like landscaping and routine maintenance can be put on hold for a few weeks without too much trouble they still have to provide for things like emergency maintenance for their renters as well as deal with many of the day to day operationsFree rent would be comparable to making the food free at the restaurant making the rooms free at the hotel making the concert halls have to put on shows for free making the stores have to give away products for freeIf you think about any business there is a base cost to operate and a cost per customer  When you have no customers you are losing the base cost to operate  When you have customers but cant charge them money you are losing both the base cost to operate and the cost per customerIf you are going to make the rent free then you need to make the services that landlords consume to provide the rent like plumbing free which means you now have to figure out want to do with the providers of those services having to work without pay|1

LOL the most hysterical people I have read over the past week at the people saying people need to stop panicking  They have hardly even started testing for the virus and there is already plenty of evidence that current tests have missed cases multiple times even in the same patient  The number of reported cases is the absolute lowest number out there as there is no way they have found every infected person  Then add to that this virus has a progression that sees an incubation period plus a week or so of mild symptoms very similar to any other cold or flu before possibly diving into the notably nasty stuff   We wont know the full impact here until we have some improved testing for one  And until at least another month has past for the virus to do its thing  If we dont see a notable number of pneumonia patients in the next month or two then maybe we can consider ourselves out of the woods|0

You look at how many confirmed cases there are you look at the growth rate of the infection and how it spreads From that you conclude that there must be more unidentified cases because the spread and infection rate is so high You then run a computer simulation that simulates this tweaking the parameter for  of symptomless cases until you find a simulation that lines up with your measured data Then you can reasonably predict what that number might beHere are some visual representations of very simplified simulations if youre interested  httpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphics2020worldcoronasimulatorhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphics2020worldcoronasimulator Source I do mathematical simulation for a living in finance but the principle is the same|1

Given the fact that it had part of its sequence similar to HIV it makes sense an antiretroviral helps but using Oseltamivir which is used for influenza is confusing That means the coronavirus would have to express the same enzyme neuraminidase as influenza My guess is they are basically just throwing every drug at it that they can think of and seeing what sticks  It may turn out later that only one of these was the active ingredient in curing the woman|1

So I was asking why this is The CDC is testing In order for other places to legally test the method has to be FDA approved which takes several months Under these circumstances emergency use of a test method can be authorized EUA The CDC just released their test as EUA This means that other labs mainly State Labs will soon be able to start testing This was what happened with Zika  My lab brought in an EUA test during that outbreakSo I know this sub loves conspiracy theories but heres an answer from somebody nearer to the situation|1

Did i ever say it happens to the entire human population  And did i ever use the word bacterial or viral infection  What i said was that certain people like me can catch a similar cold or flu like disease upon consuming something cold which can later become a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics It might be unfamiliar to you because you dont have such an issue like the majority of the people with a strong immune system It could be due to a number of reasons such as histamine incompatibility restricted blood flow because of temparature drop or another autoimmune response|1

This is really upsetting to me because I went through something similar when I had to go on disability and was in the hospital literally weekly with severe pain passing out and anaphylaxis Of course It took me years to get a diagnosis but just going on disability plus the hospital destroyed my credit for 7 years It is only beginning to get back to normal and Ive had to put off school and such because of this Had I been able to better afford doctors Id have a PhD right now but it just wasnt feasible Especially since I am no longer sick enough or have a qualifying condition for disability its all a crock of shitx200BIm glad that she wa able to get back on her feet  medical debt is the 1 problem in this country when it comes to people being broke All it takes is 1 emergency or a bad bout of sickness to shoot your finances to hell Its astounding and terrifying|0

Since SK is the country with most testing so has the best data on infection rate Im scaling up their numbers to our population so maybe 46k infected in the US But I think it spread to them earlier so we are for now lower on the curve|0
The trouble is that the people of China are unprepared for democracy as bad as that sounds For as many young people with access to social media there are more without and thats assuming that young people are homogenous in their opposition to the ccp which is sadly untrue The brainwashing and effects of the cultural revolution have altered the psyche and culture of the Chinese people so thoroughly that they need to be brought down gently and gradually not with some sudden transition|0

I think your parents are wrong They have not analyzed the situation You seem to see things more clearly I dont want to tell you that the risk is not thereOf course there is a risk There are always risks and sometimes a new risk comes along and makes us worryOn the plus side it is by far not certain that the virus will reach you at all Even if it does the likelihood of getting severely sick from this disease is low It is lower for younger people and apparently still lower for females Many people get only symptoms like those of a common cold some do not have symptoms at all So much for the rational sideMy opinion is that fear and worrying does not help us much Neither do other things Unless you go to the extreme effort of fullscale prepping to avoid infection by all means there is really not much you can do other than eating healthy food and enjoying lifeI would keep trying to convince your parents to allow you to visit a doctor and perhaps get a diagnosis and some medicine for the cough If you will go to the doctor please let me know here because then there are a few additional hints If not I still think you have not much to worry about but if you still do please keep talking about it here Do you think your fears are rational or irrational I can help better with the rational side but I think others here know the psychological side well|0
 but remember that a lot of service workers and the creatives of Austin lose out on this Just FWIW if there had been a spread there it would have had a sizable chance of killing many of their parents and grandparents and stuff|0

Maybe because people lost faith in the government Speaking for myself I lost it pretty quickly due to keeping myself informed from the moment it became a thing and seeing how the RIVM was stumbling all along I have faith in Rutte to do the best he can I just dont trust his experts implicitly not trusting him as well    So what would be the result of complaining Besides taking away precious time from them having the government fall and crumble is one scenario and I cant think of any better scenarios The best you can do is take care of yourself and those closest to you In that sense I agree with Rutte for the Netherlands to deal with this we need all 17mil of us|1

The story would be a start to a bigger issue which would shed light on the fact that people with Covid symptoms were denied testing or never got it There are plenty of people saying they cant get someone to test them How many of those people are positive and are soon to pass from flu like symptoms|1
My 12 year old son and his mother are coming in from Germany near the border of Luxembourg tomorrow Were divorced and he lives with her He will be staying with me for a week and then going back  Wondering what precautions we should all takeIm supposed to go visit him April 3rd for about a week as well  At this point is there really anything we can do aside from wash hands and be mindful of symptoms|1

I wonder what the real numbers look like They have barely done any testing outside the big clusters close to Milan I checked their testing pdf they release every day and it showed 36 tests done in South Tyrol Meanwhile over 100 people in Germany have tested positive after a visit to South Tyrol And it is exactly these states where the virus will cause the biggest damage as they have an ageing population living in small towns in the mountains|1

While a bit of preparation and cash on hand can never hurt what your inlaws are telling you to do is indeed overboard Its true that people lost their deposits during bank runs during the Great Depression but since 1933 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIChttpswwwfdicgovdepositdeposits protects all deposits up to 250000 So even in the very unlikely event that your bank does run out of cash if youre in the US the government ensures that you do not lose any of what you deposited If youre in another country Im not as certain but I would have to guess the government there would protect your money as well Hope this eases your familys fears|1

When you cough or sneeze imagine the droplet spray as a cone  Its narrow at your mouth and widens quickly and settles  So if you are sick and cover your face the narrow part of the cone youre going to catch a lot of it  If youre well and wearing a mask and someone sneezes on you you have to worry about uncovered parts of your face your chestupper body etc  And the mask wont help you avoid surface contacts  If youre unaccustomed to wearing a mask youre also more likely to be fiddling with it creating the potential for your hands to contaminate your face|0

The median doubling time has been estimated at 6 days not 3 days which is also seen from your numbers A lot of growth comes from better testing not from new patients per se|1

So now you want mothers around sick people longer when unnecessary Or just complain about AmericansBy 1996 most states and the US Congress passed laws to ensure a woman could stay in the hospital 48 hours after an uncomplicated vaginal birth and 96 hours after an uncomplicatedcesarean sectionhttpswwwverywellfamilycomgivingbirthbycsection2758508 Health plans and HMOs were required to cover this length of stay and not give incentives or disincentives to discharge you earlierThe Newborns and Mothers Health Protection Act was applauded by many women but others wanted to maintain their rights to go home as soon as possible after having a baby|0

I sympathizePhilosophically this is a problem with how our society is organized If you owned your business assets then shutting down for a few months shouldnt mean the end of your businessBut everything now is so leveraged theres no room for slowing down the treadmillThere are alternative financial systems that dont require political change which wouldnt be like this but alas this is the system we choseI dont go to church myself and support womens rights but we traded church community and family for everyone having a power career We put everyone on the treadmill and theres no community backstopI think after this crisis we need to rebuild that backstop though it doesnt have to look like it did in the past|0
There is a big difference between partially closing Lombardia and nearby region of 15 million people and closing the world hegemon of 300 million people True China locked up twice as many 700 m but China has still significantly less impact on world economy than USAWhen USA sneezes the rest of the world bleeds Dont you remember that from 2008 USA housing crisis that sent shockwaves through the world contributed to rice price surge and ultimately to Arab Sprint and Syrian bloodshed that caused more refugees in Europe than Greta can imagine There is a reason why US government is very cautious about doing harsh measures|0

No nets At least not ones that are easy to obtain when most needed Last year my income was cut in half without notice in January I went from making about 110k between me and my wife to making about 50k We have 2 kids as well Within 2 months our savings were gone and I was avoiding all bills but the house and cars Need a roof over our heads and transportation to work We would only pay utilities when needed Luckily I had my wife go stay at her mothers for a couple months with our kids so we could save as much as possible So she didnt notice when the utilities happened to go out a couple times Also she was like 1 month pregnant Soooo yeah I needed her to be safe and stress freeIt wasnt until August 5th until I was able to start at a new job Downside It had about 45 days of training and 14hr for training pay This was the toughest part Leap of faith Immediate reduction in pay We had maxed all of our credit out by then my wife was now 9 months pregnant many items were in collection many items about to be in collection Cars were being paid 30 days behind mortgage 20 days behind We were literally about 12 paychecks from rock bottom At this point I made my wife and I message every person in our phones and ask for any assistance if possible It was the most embarrassing moment in our lifes BUT with out it we would of lost everything We had several friends chip in and help out All we needed was enough to pay for essentialsIn the end it came down to 1 check making the difference Meaning had my training pay ended about 2 weeks after it did we would of lost everything We saw where rock bottom was and luckily used it as a springboard There is no safety net Its just you and the ones around you Luckily we had a couple people in our lives that had a few extra bucks to spare Without them We would have been on the streets|1

We can talk about local epicenters though and if were considering the United States probably almost any major city is going to be an epicenter since they will have likely received an infected person from overseas  WA is where it first started spreading en masse in the US though  They had hundreds or possibly thousands of cases before community spread started almost anywhere else|0
You really wonder why considering we have a larger Chinese population and the highest number of infected numbers in China|0

I mean Italys healthcare was overrun in a month And young people still need hospital care too so UKs plan is riskyPeople need to realize this is a basically a world war on a virus Our economy will get nuked but better than potentially 15 of your population dying due to healthcare overrun And we dont even know how long immunity lasts if it even exists|1
On the contrary italians are crazy about grooming and hygiene even men tend to be very wellgroomed and everyone showers a lot Its absurd that bad decisions justified with weird and tired national stereotypes could cost some countries thousands of lives uh |0

In rare casesYou almost never look at the outliers when youre trying to gauge trends in data sets Their impact on the data set is minimal In data collected 6 weeks from now the vast majority of infected cases will be represented because the majority of the incubation periods last about 3 days Source httpswwwmedrxivorgcontent1011012020020620020974v1This is the medical study which your source is citing Median is 3 days The max incubation period was 24 days That means that 11099 patients had an incubation period of that length That is 009 of infected That will have little bearing on the overall trend of the data set|0
Not saying Chinese government is great but Very few countries arent lying look at the ones thats telling the truth they get the borders shut public mass panic instantly short supplied on medical and basic commodities economy tanks its the absolute empire ending shit Smaller countries like Thailand will be destroyed if they go 100 transparent their people will starve to death before virus gets to themChina being the 2nd largest economy in the world is approaching the edge of collapse majority of their businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy all their middleclass are on burrows loans for cars houses with debtincome ratio over 50 you tell them they cant work for atleast 6 months and thus no income How are they not suppose to panic|0

 I remember seeing on Reddit first reports of a SARSlike virus coming out of China Ive elsewhere in this sub that Covid19 is actually fairly similar to SARS but worse such that some researchers proposed calling it SARS 2 to raise public awareness levels But for whatever reason Novel Coronavirus is what stuck so now you got dum dums running around saying I dont read books  I dont drink Corona anyway so I should be alright|0

Unfortunately the stigma in the US is if you wear a mask youre either seriously ill or a doomer Meanwhile in Japan theyve been wearing masks long before Covid19 for simple things like allergies cold prevention and sometimes just to keep their faces warm|0
That sure is a next level live hack lol|1
But the implications of your facts are backwards you say 80 genome similarity like that means they are similar but it actually means they are way different|1

Cleaning vinegar is perfectly fine this has a higher acetic acid concentration than cooking vinegar The hospital I previously worked at used vinegar to clean the trauma rooms because bleach left noxious fumes Heres a study where vinegar was compared against hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde for sterilizing extracted human teeth vinegar was found to be effective httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC5020301|1
Look at what we dont talk about as a cause of high prices  how our grandparents built their own houses by themselves and with the community Then present generations are completely deskilled in the ability to make housing for themselves  theyre trapped by their ignorance of blue collar skillsIts just one factor but it interests me nobody talks about that This is my opinion of course  Im not ranting at you I upvote everybody who talks to me|1

If it makes you feel any better he basically is when it comes to the science side of things and he has been good about correcting officials I wouldnt however expect him to know or understand the social and legal implications of what me may recommend|1
Was this today The death numbers are way off|0
I actually agree with your sentiments with the exception of knowing what you dont know its a well known phrase alluding to intellectual humility  It is very much thishttpsyoutubeCG2cux6RcwI know what I dont know in the sense that Im building a house I know I dont know how to accurately calculate stress tension and compression for square section steel because of my knowledge about my lack of knowledge I am able to look at other buildings of similar designloading and use the same or higher spec steel without risking structural failure|1
Oh fuck off I absolutely despise the Chinese government and am no big fan of many aspects of Chinese culture however many people are very much against wet markets in China Especially the eating of wild animals from them there was a thing a couple years ago where some celebrity ate a bat and she got tons of shit for it Its hardly everyone in China that thinks thats a good idea its a dumbass minority and it just so happens every minority is large when youre in that populated a country|0

Its too bad that people see price gouging as a negative  its actually an economic good It makes people mad but it really does address the problem in the most fair way possible The nonlinear pricing of the danish supermarket is vulnerable to one person or a small group returning to the store multiple times to keep getting the cheap price They could still clean out the shop for the low price then resell them at a more realistic average price|0
